# ENNU Life Implementation Roadmap (Updated: July 2025)

This document reflects the current state of the plugin at **v26.0.54**, after the modular-config refactor, Health Dossier launch, and Admin Health Dashboard completion.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundational Stability & Core UX (Completed)

**Objective:** To resolve all critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, and architectural flaws, establishing a stable and maintainable codebase. This phase is **100% complete**.

### Key Milestones Achieved:

-   **[✓] Architectural Refactoring**: Centralized all hardcoded questions and scoring logic into dedicated configuration files.
-   **[✓] Code Consolidation**: Removed all redundant and conflicting classes, resolving fatal error risks.
-   **[✓] Security Hardening**: Patched major vulnerabilities and standardized security procedures.
-   **[✓] Core Bug Fixes**: Repaired the plugin activation hook, the score saving/display loop, and all identified data inconsistencies.
-   **[✓] User Experience Implementation**: Fully implemented the required user journeys for new, guest, and logged-in users, including global field synchronization.
-   **[✓] Admin UI Enhancements**: The admin user profile now correctly renders all field types and displays detailed scoring information.

## ✅ Phase 2: User-Facing Results & Rich Content (Completed)

**Objective:** To build a rich, dynamic, and personalized results page for the end-user. This is the most critical next step to deliver value and complete the core assessment loop.

### Initiatives & Granular Details:

1.  **Build Dynamic Results Page Template**
    *   **Task**: Create a new, professionally designed page template (`templates/assessment-results.php`).
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   The template will be triggered by a new shortcode: `[ennu_assessment_results]`.
        *   It will use a short-lived WordPress transient (`ennu_assessment_results_{user_id}`) to securely retrieve the results of the most recently completed assessment.
        *   The page will be styled with modern CSS, including a two-column layout for desktop and a responsive stacked layout for mobile.

2.  **Implement Personalized Content Engine**
    *   **Task**: Create a new configuration file (`includes/config/results-content.php`) to house all user-facing text.
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   This file will be a structured PHP array, mapping `assessment_type` and `score_interpretation` (e.g., 'excellent', 'good') to specific content.
        *   The results page template will load this file and select the appropriate `title`, `summary`, `recommendations`, and `call_to_action` text based on the user's score.
        *   This makes all user-facing content easily editable without touching any PHP logic files.

3.  **Display Detailed Category Score Breakdown**
    *   **Task**: Enhance the results page to show not just the overall score, but the score for each category.
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   The `calculate_scores` method will be updated to return a detailed `category_scores` array.
        *   This array will be saved to the transient and displayed on the results page as a list, with each category's score represented by a visual progress bar.

## Phase 3: Advanced Admin Dashboards & Analytics

**Objective:** To provide administrators with high-level insights into assessment data and user engagement.

### Initiatives & Granular Details:

1.  **Create a Main Admin Dashboard Page**
    *   **Task**: Build a new top-level admin page under the "ENNU Life" menu.
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   This will involve creating a new method in `class-enhanced-admin.php` to render the page.
        *   It will feature "stat cards" at the top for key metrics: Total Assessments Completed, New Assessments This Month, and Total Active Users.
        *   These stats will be calculated via efficient database queries.

2.  **Implement Visual Charts**
    *   **Task**: Integrate a JavaScript charting library (e.g., Chart.js) to display visual data on the dashboard.
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   Create a new AJAX endpoint to provide data specifically for the charts.
        *   The first chart will be a bar chart showing the total number of completions for each assessment type.
        *   The second chart will be a line chart showing assessment submissions over the last 30 days.

3.  **Historical Data Table**
    *   **Task**: Add a table to the dashboard that shows the 25 most recently completed assessments.
    *   **Technical Details**: This will be powered by a direct database query that joins the `usermeta` and `users` tables to display the user, assessment type, score, and date for each recent submission.

## Phase 4: Long-Term Enhancements (Future)

**Objective**: To build out advanced features that increase user engagement and provide deeper business intelligence.

-   **User-Facing History**: Allow logged-in users to view a history of all their past assessment results and see their progress over time.
-   **Email Automation**: Create a system to automatically send follow-up emails based on a user's score (e.g., a "check-in" email for users with low scores).
-   **Advanced Integrations**: Deeper integration with CRM and marketing platforms, pushing not just contact info but detailed assessment scores and categories.
-   **Full-Text Search**: Implement a search feature in the admin to find users based on specific answers to questions.

## ✅ Phase 5: User Dashboard & Health Dossier (Completed)
_Status: delivered in v26.0.54. Mini-charts, pillar summary, and detailed “Health Dossier” are live._

### Key Milestones Achieved

* Historical score tracking saved to user meta and plotted on the dossier timeline.
* Quad-Pillars visualization and AI narrative.
* Deep-dive modals and detail pages for each assessment.

---

## Phase 6: The Interactive Health Engine (In Progress)

### Initiatives & Granular Details (target v26.1.x):

1.  **Implement the "What-If" Simulator**
    *   **Task**: Create a new interactive module on the Health Dossier page that allows users to adjust their answers (via sliders/toggles) and see their scores update in real-time.
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   This will require significant new JavaScript in `health-dossier.js` to manage state, handle user input, and re-render the Health Pillar charts without a page reload.
        *   The scoring logic from `class-scoring-system.php` will need to be partially replicated in JavaScript to power the instant calculations.

2.  **Introduce Gamification: Achievements & Goal Setting**
    *   **Task**: Build an "Achievements" section to display unlocked badges and allow users to set personal score goals.
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   Create a new `ennu_achievements` database table or use user meta to store unlocked badges.
        *   Develop a new `ENNU_Achievements_Engine` class to check for triggers (e.g., `on_assessment_complete` hook) and award badges.
        *   Update the `user-dashboard.php` and `assessment-details-page.php` templates to display the unlocked achievements and the goal-setting interface.

## Phase 7: The Proprietary Intelligence Platform (Planned 2026)

### Initiatives & Granular Details:

1.  **Develop the "ENNU Index"**
    *   **Task**: Design and implement a new, proprietary top-level health score.
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   Create a new, sophisticated algorithm that calculates the "ENNU Index" based on a weighted combination of pillar scores, historical trends, and user engagement.
        *   This will likely require a new `ENNU_Index_Calculator` class and new user meta fields to store the index and its history.

2.  **Build the "Digital Coach" - Proactive AI Interventions**
    *   **Task**: Create an automated system that analyzes user results and sends personalized "missions" via email or push notification.
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   This requires a new WP Cron job that runs daily to analyze recent user data.
        *   It will integrate deeply with the `ENNU_Life_Email_System` to send the templated, personalized mission emails.
        *   New UI will be needed for users to see their "active mission."

3.  **Implement Anonymous Cohort Analysis & Data Monetization**
    *   **Task**: Display anonymous social comparison data on the user's dossier and build the backend to support data aggregation.
    *   **Technical Details**:
        *   This is the most complex feature. It requires a second WP Cron job to periodically process all user data, calculate aggregate statistics (e.g., average scores by demographic), and store them in a new custom database table.
        *   The Health Dossier template will then query this aggregate table to provide the comparison data. Great care must be taken to ensure all data is anonymized to protect user privacy.
