## ✅ Phase 1: Foundational Stability & Core UX (Completed)

**Objective:** To resolve all critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, and architectural flaws, establishing a stable and maintainable codebase. This phase is **100% complete**.

### Key Milestones Achieved:

-   **[✓] Architectural Refactoring**: Centralized all hardcoded questions and scoring logic into dedicated configuration files.
-   **[✓] Code Consolidation**: Removed all redundant and conflicting classes, resolving fatal error risks.
-   **[✓] Security Hardening**: Patched major vulnerabilities, including `extract()` usage, insecure polyfills, and inconsistent AJAX nonces.
-   **[✓] Core Bug Fixes**: Repaired the plugin activation hook, fixed the score saving/display loop, and resolved all identified data inconsistencies.
-   **[✓] User Experience Implementation**: Fully implemented the required user journeys for new, guest, and logged-in users, including global field synchronization across WP Core and WooCommerce.
-   **[✓] Code Cleanup**: Removed dead code, unused hooks, and unnecessary dependencies (including the initial WooCommerce product creation code).

## Phase 2: User-Facing Results & Admin UI

**Objective:** To build the necessary user interface for displaying assessment results to both the end-user and the site administrator. This will complete the core value loop of the plugin.

### Key Initiatives:

1.  **Admin Score Display Enhancements**:
    -   **Task**: Design and implement a visually organized dashboard within the user profile page to display scores for each completed assessment.
    -   **Details**: This should include score interpretations and potentially a graphical representation (e.g., a simple bar chart or "radar" chart) to show category scores. This replaces the current simple text list.

2.  **User-Facing Results Page**:
    -   **Task**: Create a dynamic "Thank You" / "Results" page template.
    -   **Details**: After a user completes an assessment, they should be redirected to a page that displays their overall score, interpretation, and a brief summary of their results. This makes the tool immediately useful to the end-user.

3.  **Email Notifications with Scores**:
    -   **Task**: Enhance the email notification system.
    -   **Details**: The confirmation emails sent to users and admins should be updated to include the calculated score and a direct link to the new results page.

## Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & Engagement

**Objective:** To implement the advanced data-tracking features outlined in the user experience documentation, turning the plugin from a simple assessment tool into a powerful analytics platform.

### Key Initiatives:

1.  **Implement Hidden System Fields**:
    -   **Task**: Begin capturing the "hidden system fields" specified in the UX documentation.
    -   **Details**: This includes technical data (User-Agent, IP address), marketing attribution (UTM tags, referrer), and basic engagement metrics (time spent on assessment).

2.  **Historical Data & Trend Analysis**:
    -   **Task**: Create a new custom database table or post type to store historical assessment results.
    -   **Details**: This will allow for tracking a user's progress over time and is the foundation for any future trend analysis or charting features.

3.  **Admin Dashboard V2**:
    -   **Task**: Build a high-level admin dashboard page.
    *   **Details**: This page would show aggregate data, such as the average score for each assessment, completion rates, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Phase 4: Integrations & Automation (Future)

**Objective**: To connect the assessment data to other services and automate workflows.

-   **CRM Integration**: Deeper integration with HubSpot or other CRMs, pushing detailed assessment results to contact records.
-   **Email Marketing Automation**: Trigger automated email sequences based on assessment scores (e.g., a follow-up campaign for users with a "Needs Attention" score).
-   **Advanced WooCommerce Integration**: Re-introduce functionality to create and recommend specific WooCommerce products based on assessment results.
