**Last Updated:** December 18, 2024  
**Version:** 59.0.0  
**Status:** Active Tracking

---

## Overview

This document tracks all identified technical debt in the ENNU Life Assessments plugin. Each item is categorized by severity, effort required, and business impact. This serves as the authoritative list for prioritizing modernization efforts.

---

## Critical Priority (Address Immediately)

### 1. Complete Absence of Automated Testing
**Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Effort:** Large (2-3 weeks)  
**Impact:** High risk of regression bugs, difficult to refactor safely

**Details:**
- No unit tests for scoring algorithms
- No integration tests for AJAX endpoints
- Only one basic Cypress test exists
- No performance benchmarks
- No visual regression testing

**Recommendation:** Start with PHPUnit for backend, Jest for frontend

---

### 2. jQuery Dependency Throughout
**Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Effort:** Large (2 weeks)  
**Impact:** Blocks modern development, security concerns, performance impact

**Details:**
- All JavaScript files depend on jQuery 3.7.1
- Modern vanilla JS can replace 95% of jQuery usage
- Prevents use of modern frameworks
- Increases bundle size unnecessarily

**Files Affected:**
- `assets/js/ennu-frontend-forms.js`
- `assets/js/user-dashboard.js`
- `assets/js/ennu-admin.js`
- All other JS files

---

### 3. No Build Process
**Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Effort:** Medium (3-4 days)  
**Impact:** Manual deployment, no optimization, no modern JS features

**Details:**
- No webpack/rollup/vite configuration
- No asset minification
- No tree shaking
- No code splitting
- Manual version bumping

**Recommendation:** Implement Vite for fast builds and modern features

---

## High Priority (Address in Q1 2025)

### 4. Client-Side Only Validation
**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ High  
**Effort:** Medium (1 week)  
**Impact:** Security vulnerability, poor UX on errors

**Details:**
- Form validation happens only in JavaScript
- Server accepts any data that passes nonce check
- No server-side data type validation
- Inconsistent error messages

---

### 5. Deprecated JavaScript Patterns
**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ High  
**Effort:** Small (2-3 days)  
**Impact:** Poor developer experience, maintenance difficulty

**Details:**
- Uses `alert()` and `confirm()` for user dialogs
- Hard-coded `setTimeout` delays
- IIFEs instead of modules
- Global namespace pollution

**Files:**
- `assets/js/ennu-admin.js` (lines with alert/confirm)
- Multiple files with setTimeout hacks

---

### 6. No API Layer
**Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ High  
**Effort:** Large (2-3 weeks)  
**Impact:** Limits integration options, blocks mobile app development

**Details:**
- All interactions through admin-ajax.php
- No REST API endpoints
- No GraphQL support
- No webhook system
- Difficult to build mobile apps

---

## Medium Priority (Address in Q2 2025)

### 7. Basic Caching Strategy
**Severity:** ðŸŸ  Medium  
**Effort:** Medium (1 week)  
**Impact:** Performance issues at scale

**Details:**
- Only uses WordPress transients
- No Redis/Memcached integration
- No edge caching strategy
- Score calculations not optimized

---

### 8. Monolithic JavaScript Classes
**Severity:** ðŸŸ  Medium  
**Effort:** Medium (1 week)  
**Impact:** Difficult to test, maintain, and extend

**Details:**
- `ENNUAssessmentForm` handles too many responsibilities
- `ENNUAdminEnhanced` is a "God Object"
- No separation of concerns
- Tight coupling between components

---

### 9. Inconsistent Naming Conventions
**Severity:** ðŸŸ  Medium  
**Effort:** Small (1-2 days)  
**Impact:** Developer confusion, potential bugs

**Details:**
- Localization objects: `ennu_admin`, `ennuAdmin`, `ennu_ajax`, `dashboardData`
- Mix of camelCase and snake_case
- Inconsistent prefixing

---

## Low Priority (Nice to Have)

### 10. No Progressive Web App Features
**Severity:** ðŸŸ¢ Low  
**Effort:** Medium (1 week)  
**Impact:** Missed opportunity for offline capability

**Details:**
- No service worker
- No offline support
- No push notifications
- No app manifest

---

### 11. Limited Accessibility Features
**Severity:** ðŸŸ¢ Low  
**Effort:** Medium (1 week)  
**Impact:** Excludes users with disabilities

**Details:**
- Missing ARIA labels
- Poor keyboard navigation
- No screen reader optimization
- Color contrast issues in some areas

---

### 12. No Internationalization
**Severity:** ðŸŸ¢ Low  
**Effort:** Large (2-3 weeks)  
**Impact:** Limited to English-speaking markets

**Details:**
- Hard-coded English strings
- No translation files
- No RTL support
- Date/number formatting issues

---

## Code Smells (Refactor When Touching)

### 13. Debug Code in Production
**Location:** `assets/js/admin-scores-enhanced.js`
```javascript
debugMode: false  // Line 24
```

### 14. Console Logging
**Location:** Multiple files
- Should use proper logging service
- Remove or conditionally compile

### 15. Magic Numbers
**Location:** Throughout scoring system
- Score thresholds hard-coded
- Animation delays hard-coded
- Should use named constants

### 16. Long Functions
**Location:** `class-assessment-shortcodes.php`
- `handle_assessment_submission()` - 250+ lines
- Should be broken into smaller methods

### 17. Duplicate Code
**Location:** Chart initialization in multiple files
- Same Chart.js setup repeated
- Should be abstracted to utility

---

## Performance Bottlenecks

### 18. N+1 Query Issues (Partially Fixed)
**Status:** Partially addressed in v29.0.0
- User meta queries in loops
- Could benefit from better caching

### 19. Large Bundle Sizes
- Chart.js loaded on every page
- jQuery loaded globally
- No lazy loading

### 20. No HTTP/2 Push
- Assets loaded sequentially
- No resource hints
- No critical CSS

---

## Security Considerations

### 21. Rate Limiting (Client-Side Only)
**Current:** JavaScript rate limiting
**Need:** Server-side implementation

### 22. No Content Security Policy
- Missing CSP headers
- XSS vulnerability potential

### 23. Session Management
- Token expiry could be improved
- No refresh token mechanism

---

## Maintenance Issues

### 24. Manual Deployment
- No CI/CD pipeline
- No automated tests before deploy
- Manual version bumping

### 25. Limited Error Tracking
- Errors only logged to browser console
- No Sentry/Rollbar integration
- Difficult to debug production issues

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (This Week)**
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier
   - Create initial PHPUnit test structure
   - Document build process requirements

2. **Q1 2025 Focus**

   - Remove jQuery dependency (Critical #2)
   - Set up build pipeline (Critical #3)

3. **Ongoing**
   - Refactor code smells as encountered
   - Document decisions in ADR format
   - Track new debt as identified
