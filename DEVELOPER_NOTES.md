## 3. Core Architectural Principles

Any future development must adhere to these core principles to maintain the integrity of the system:

1.  **Configuration Over Code**: All content—questions, options, scoring rules, categories, weights, and contextual insights—belongs in the configuration files within `includes/config/`. The PHP classes should be generic "engines" that read from this configuration.
2.  **Single Source of Truth**: The `assessment-definitions.php` file is the one and only place where assessment content is defined. The `dashboard-insights.php` file is the one and only place for all descriptive text on the user dashboard.
3.  **Encapsulation & Centralized Hooks**: Logic is strictly encapsulated into classes with specific responsibilities. All WordPress action and filter hooks are managed from the central plugin file (`ennu-life-plugin.php`) to guarantee a stable and predictable initialization sequence.

## 4. Key Data Flow & Longitudinal Tracking

1.  **Submission**: A user submits an assessment via a nonce-protected AJAX request.
2.  **Global Data Persistence**: The system intelligently saves all fields marked with a `global_key` (e.g., Name, DOB, Gender, Height, Weight) to the user's meta.
3.  **Scoring Calculation**: The `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring` class calculates:
    *   An `overall_score` for the specific assessment.
    *   A breakdown of `category_scores`.
    *   The four `pillar_scores` (Mind, Body, Lifestyle, Aesthetics).
4.  **ENNU LIFE SCORE Calculation**: Immediately after, the system recalculates the master **ENNU LIFE SCORE** and the average pillar scores, saving both to user meta.
5.  **Historical Archiving**:
    *   The `completion_timestamp` and the new `ennu_life_score` are both saved to a historical array (`ennu_life_score_history`).
    *   If height and weight were submitted, the calculated BMI and a `completion_timestamp` are saved to a new historical array (`ennu_bmi_history`).
6.  **Tokenized Redirect**: The system generates a secure, one-time-use token and redirects the user to a unique results page (e.g., `/hair-results/?results_token=...`).
7.  **Results Rendering**: The results page uses the token to securely retrieve the assessment data from a transient, displaying a "Bio-Metric Canvas" style summary. It then deletes the transient.
8.  **Dashboard Rendering**: The main `[ennu-user-dashboard]` shortcode fetches all permanent data, including both the score and BMI histories, filters assessments based on the user's gender, and renders the full "Bio-Metric Canvas" with its historical trend charts.

## 5. The Administrative Toolkit

Version 57.1.0 introduced a powerful set of tools on the user profile page in the WordPress admin, transforming it into an interactive dossier.

*   **Interactive Tabs**: All global user data and assessment-specific answers are now organized into a clean, intuitive tabbed interface.
*   **Editable Global Fields**: Key global data points, such as "Health Goals" and "Height & Weight," are now editable directly from the admin panel.
*   **Administrative Actions**: A new section provides administrators with three powerful, nonce-protected AJAX actions:
    *   **Recalculate All Scores**: Re-runs the entire scoring engine for the user.
    *   **Clear All Assessment Data**: A destructive action (with confirmation) to completely wipe a user's `ennu_` meta data.
    *   **Clear Single Assessment Data**: A granular tool to wipe the data for one specific assessment and then trigger a recalculation of the master score.

These features are handled by `ENNU_Enhanced_Admin` and the corresponding JavaScript in `assets/js/ennu-admin.js`.

## 6. Current Technical State

### Backend (PHP) - EXCELLENT ✅
The server-side architecture is robust and well-designed:
- Clean OOP structure with SOLID principles
- Comprehensive error handling
- Secure AJAX operations with nonce protection
- Efficient database operations with caching
- Well-documented configuration system

### Frontend (JavaScript) - NEEDS MODERNIZATION ⚠️
The client-side code is functional but outdated:
- Heavy jQuery dependency (should migrate to vanilla JS)
- No module system (using IIFEs and global namespaces)
- Uses deprecated patterns (alert/confirm dialogs)
- Lacks proper build pipeline
- No state management system

### Testing - CRITICAL GAP ❌
The most significant risk to long-term stability:
- No unit tests for scoring algorithms
- No integration tests for AJAX endpoints
- Minimal E2E test coverage (one basic Cypress test)
- No performance benchmarks
- No visual regression testing

---

## 7. Immediate Priorities for 2025

### Phase 1: Testing Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
1. Set up PHPUnit for backend testing
2. Implement Jest for frontend unit tests
3. Expand Cypress E2E test suite
4. Add performance benchmarking

### Phase 2: JavaScript Modernization (Weeks 3-4)
1. Migrate from jQuery to vanilla JavaScript
2. Implement ES6+ modules
3. Add proper state management
4. Create build pipeline (Webpack/Vite)

### Phase 3: Security & Performance (Week 5-6)
1. Comprehensive security audit
2. Implement server-side rate limiting
3. Optimize database queries
4. Enhanced caching strategies

## 8. Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Resolved Issues ✅
- Assessment toggle functionality (v58.0.3)
- Pillar scores display (v58.0.4-v58.0.6)
- Health optimization counts (v58.0.3)
- Progress charts on detail pages (v58.0.3)
- Main score insight animation (v58.0.7)

### Remaining Technical Debt
- JavaScript needs complete modernization
- No automated testing coverage
- Build process is manual
- Limited API endpoints for modern frontends
- Client-side only validation in many places

---

## 9. Development Guidelines

### When Adding Features
1. Always update `assessment-definitions.php` for new questions
2. Follow the existing OOP patterns
3. Add proper error handling
4. Update the changelog
5. Test across different user states

### When Fixing Bugs
1. Identify root cause (not just symptoms)
2. Add debugging logs during development
3. Test edge cases
4. Update relevant documentation
5. Consider adding regression tests

### Code Standards
- Follow WordPress Coding Standards
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused (single responsibility)
- Validate and sanitize all inputs

## 10. Future Vision

The plugin is positioned for significant growth:

1. **API-First Architecture**: Prepare for headless WordPress deployments
2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Predictive health scoring
3. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket support for live updates
4. **Mobile Applications**: Native app support via REST API
5. **Enterprise Features**: Multi-tenant support, advanced analytics

The foundation is solid. The next phase is modernization and scale.
