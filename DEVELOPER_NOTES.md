## 1. Project Status: "ENNULIFE Journey" Evolution

Following a successful frontend modernization, the plugin is now entering a new phase of evolution: **The ENNU LIFE Journey**. This phase will transform the plugin from a static scoring tool into a dynamic, personalized health platform.

This document outlines the architectural blueprint for this new, more sophisticated system.

---

## 2. The "ENNULIFE Journey" Architecture

The core of this evolution is a new, decoupled scoring and recommendation engine. The monolithic `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring` class will be refactored into a suite of specialized calculators, orchestrated by a lean controller.

### 2.1 The New Calculator & Engine Suite

*   **`class-assessment-calculator.php`**: Calculates the `overall_score` for a single assessment.
*   **`class-category-score-calculator.php`**: Calculates the detailed category score breakdown for an assessment.
*   **`class-pillar-score-calculator.php`**: Calculates the "base" average score for the four Pillars (Mind, Body, Lifestyle, Aesthetics).
*   **`class-health-optimization-calculator.php`**: Calculates Pillar Integrity Penalties from symptoms and determines recommended biomarkers.
*   **`class-potential-score-calculator.php`**: Calculates the user's aspirational "Potential Score" based on their recommendations.
*   **`class-ennu-life-score-calculator.php`**: Calculates the final, adjusted ENNU LIFE SCORE, now factoring in Health Goals.
*   **`class-recommendation-engine.php`**: Generates all personalized recommendation text based on scores and user data.
*   **`class-score-completeness-calculator.php`**: Calculates the "score completeness" percentage.
*   **`class-scoring-system.php` (Orchestrator):** The existing class, refactored to manage and delegate to the new calculators.

### 2.2 New Core Concepts

*   **Potential ENNU LIFE SCORE:** An aspirational score representing the user's health potential if they follow all recommendations. This will be the "north star" of their journey.
*   **Health Goals Integration:** Health Goals will now have a direct mathematical impact on the final ENNU LIFE SCORE, likely as a multiplier or bonus, to reflect user intent.
*   **Score Completeness Tracker:** A new metric that encourages users to complete more assessments, set their goals, and provide more data to get the most accurate score possible.
*   **Gender-Conscious Questioning:** The system will be enhanced to allow for different questions, options, or scoring based on a user's gender, providing a truly personalized experience.

---

## 3. New Data Persistence Model

To support this new architecture, the following new `user_meta` keys will be created:

*   `ennu_potential_life_score`: Stores the user's calculated potential score.
*   `ennu_score_completeness`: Stores the score completeness percentage.
*   `ennu_personalized_recommendations`: Stores the generated recommendation text in a structured format.

---

## 4. Enhanced User Dashboard

The user dashboard will be significantly enhanced to display the outputs of our new engine:

*   **Potential Score Visualization:** The main score orb will be updated to show the "Potential Score" as a ghosted or aspirational arc.
*   **Score Completeness UI:** A new progress bar will visually represent the user's score completeness.
*   **Interactive Health Goals Module:** A new section will allow users to view and update their health goals directly from the dashboard, powered by a new AJAX endpoint.
*   **Unified Recommendation Hub:** A new, centralized hub will display all personalized recommendations.

---

## 5. Enhanced Admin View

The admin user profile page will be updated to display all new data points, including the Potential Score and Score Completeness, providing administrators with a complete picture of the user's journey.

---

## 6. Development Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1: Architecture & Data Model:** Define the logic for the new calculators and data fields.
2.  **Phase 2: Backend Implementation:** Build the new calculator suite and refactor the orchestrator.
3.  **Phase 3: Frontend & Admin Implementation:** Build the new UI components and AJAX functionality.
4.  **Phase 4: Fortification & Finalization:** Write comprehensive tests for all new features and update all documentation.

## 3. Core Architectural Principles

Any future development must adhere to these core principles to maintain the integrity of the system:

1.  **Configuration Over Code**: All content—questions, options, scoring rules, categories, weights, and contextual insights—belongs in the configuration files within `includes/config/`. The PHP classes should be generic "engines" that read from this configuration.
2.  **Single Source of Truth**: The `assessment-definitions.php` file is the one and only place where assessment content is defined. The `dashboard-insights.php` file is the one and only place for all descriptive text on the user dashboard.
3.  **Encapsulation & Centralized Hooks**: Logic is strictly encapsulated into classes with specific responsibilities. All WordPress action and filter hooks are managed from the central plugin file (`ennu-life-plugin.php`) to guarantee a stable and predictable initialization sequence.

---

## 4. Key Data Flow & Longitudinal Tracking

1.  **Submission**: A user submits an assessment via a nonce-protected AJAX request.
2.  **Global Data Persistence**: The system intelligently saves all fields marked with a `global_key` (e.g., Name, DOB, Gender, Height, Weight) to the user's meta.
3.  **Scoring Calculation**: The `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring` class calculates:
    *   An `overall_score` for the specific assessment.
    *   A breakdown of `category_scores`.
    *   The four `pillar_scores` (Mind, Body, Lifestyle, Aesthetics).
4.  **ENNU LIFE SCORE Calculation**: Immediately after, the system recalculates the master **ENNU LIFE SCORE** and the average pillar scores, saving both to user meta.
5.  **Historical Archiving**:
    *   The `completion_timestamp` and the new `ennu_life_score` are both saved to a historical array (`ennu_life_score_history`).
    *   If height and weight were submitted, the calculated BMI and a `completion_timestamp` are saved to a new historical array (`ennu_bmi_history`).
6.  **Tokenized Redirect**: The system generates a secure, one-time-use token and redirects the user to a unique results page (e.g., `/hair-results/?results_token=...`).
7.  **Results Rendering**: The results page uses the token to securely retrieve the assessment data from a transient, displaying a "Bio-Metric Canvas" style summary. It then deletes the transient.
8.  **Dashboard Rendering**: The main `[ennu-user-dashboard]` shortcode fetches all permanent data, including both the score and BMI histories, filters assessments based on the user's gender, and renders the full "Bio-Metric Canvas" with its historical trend charts.

---

## 5. The Administrative Toolkit

Version 57.1.0 introduced a powerful set of tools on the user profile page in the WordPress admin, transforming it into an interactive dossier.

*   **Interactive Tabs**: All global user data and assessment-specific answers are now organized into a clean, intuitive tabbed interface.
*   **Editable Global Fields**: Key global data points, such as "Health Goals" and "Height & Weight," are now editable directly from the admin panel.
*   **Administrative Actions**: A new section provides administrators with three powerful, nonce-protected AJAX actions:
    *   **Recalculate All Scores**: Re-runs the entire scoring engine for the user.
    *   **Clear All Assessment Data**: A destructive action (with confirmation) to completely wipe a user's `ennu_` meta data.
    *   **Clear Single Assessment Data**: A granular tool to wipe the data for one specific assessment and then trigger a recalculation of the master score.

These features are handled by `ENNU_Enhanced_Admin` and the corresponding JavaScript in `assets/js/ennu-admin.js`.
