## 2.0 Architectural Deep Dive: The Pillars of a Perfect Plugin

Understanding the plugin's architecture is key to understanding its stability and maintainability.

### 2.1 The Central Controller: `ennu-life-plugin.php`

The main plugin file, `ennu-life-plugin.php`, acts as the central controller or "brain" of the entire system. It follows a Singleton pattern (`ENNU_Life_Enhanced_Plugin::get_instance()`) to ensure it only ever runs once.

-   **Responsibilities**:
    1.  **Loading Dependencies**: It is responsible for `require_once` all other class files from the `/includes/` directory in the correct order.
    2.  **Component Initialization**: It instantiates the key classes (`ENNU_Enhanced_Admin`, `ENNU_Assessment_Shortcodes`, etc.).
    3.  **Centralized Hook Registration**: Critically, the `setup_hooks()` method within this file is the **single source of truth** for all `add_action` and `add_filter` calls that connect the plugin's functionality to the WordPress core. This prevents conflicts and makes the loading sequence predictable and debuggable.

### 2.2 Unified Data Architecture: The `assessment-definitions.php` File

This is the most important configuration file in the plugin. Located at `includes/config/assessment-definitions.php`, it is the single source of truth for all assessment content. This includes:
-   All questions, their types, and their options.
-   The complete scoring logic, including point values and category weights.
-   Metadata for the assessments themselves, such as the `gender_filter` key, which controls visibility.

This unified architecture eliminates the need for complex "mapper" classes and makes the system exceptionally easy to maintain and extend.

## 3.0 The Core User Journey: From First Click to Final Insight

The plugin's functionality is built around a core user journey. Understanding this flow is key to understanding the system's perfection.

1.  **Initiation**: A user encounters an assessment on a page, rendered by a shortcode.
2.  **Interaction**: The user moves through a series of questions in a clean, multi-step form.
3.  **Submission**: The user's answers are sent securely to the server via AJAX.
4.  **Processing**: A new user account is created if one doesn't exist. All answers and calculated scores are saved to the user's profile. A secure, one-time-use token is generated.
5.  **Revelation (The Results Canvas)**: The user is immediately redirected to a unique results page (e.g., `/hair-results/`) using the secure token. This page displays a beautiful, "Bio-Metric Canvas" style summary of their score for the assessment they just took and provides clear next steps.
6.  **Exploration (The Bio-Metric Canvas)**: From the results page, the user can proceed to their main User Dashboard, a stunning, interactive hub featuring a central, pulsating ENNU LIFE SCORE orb and animated, score-driven Pillar Orbs for all relevant assessments.
7.  **Deep Dive (The Health Dossier)**: From the main dashboard, the user can click to view a full, permanent report for any completed assessment. This "Health Dossier" provides a detailed breakdown of their scores, historical progress charts, and other personalized data.

## 4.0 The Frontend Experience: A Flawless User Interface

This section details every facet of the end-user experience. Each claim is backed by code and has a corresponding verification step in Section 11.0.

### 4.1 Feature: The Multi-Step Assessment Form

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: When a user views a page containing an assessment shortcode (e.g., `[ennu-hair-assessment]`), they see a beautifully styled, multi-step form. The form displays one question at a time, with a clear title, a descriptive subtitle, and a progress bar. Navigation is handled by "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
-   **Intelligent Access Control**: The form will only render if it is appropriate for the user. For example, a male user attempting to access the `[ennu-menopause-assessment]` page will be shown a polite message indicating the assessment is not available for their profile, rather than the form itself.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**:
    -   **Shortcode Registration**: The `register_shortcodes` method in `includes/class-assessment-shortcodes.php` is hooked to `init`.
    -   **Rendering Engine**: `render_assessment_shortcode` in the same file renders the form's HTML structure and contains the gender-filtering logic.
    -   **Client-Side Logic**: The `ENNUAssessmentForm` class in `assets/js/ennu-frontend-forms.js` handles the step-by-step interactive logic.

### 4.2 Feature: Seamless Data Submission and User Creation

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: Clicking "Submit" securely sends data, creates a user account if one doesn't exist, saves all data, calculates scores, and redirects to a unique results page via a secure token.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**:
    -   **AJAX Endpoint**: The `handle_assessment_submission` method in `includes/class-assessment-shortcodes.php` is the target for the `wp_ajax_ennu_submit_assessment` action.
    -   **Security**: The method begins by verifying a WordPress nonce with `check_ajax_referer('ennu_ajax_nonce')`.
    -   **User Handling**: It uses `email_exists()` and `wp_insert_user()` for account management.
    -   **Data Persistence**: It saves all answers and scores to the `usermeta` table.
    -   **Tokenization**: It generates a secure, 32-character token, saves the results to a transient keyed by this token, and appends the token to the redirect URL.

## 5.0 The Dynamic Results Ecosystem

This section details the ecosystem of pages and data that make up the user's journey after completing an assessment.

### 5.1 The Immediate Results Page (The "Results Canvas")

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: After submission, the user lands on a results page unique to the assessment they just took (e.g., `/hair-results/`). This page is not static. It is a perfect, single-assessment version of the main "Bio-Metric Canvas" dashboard, featuring the same dark, futuristic aesthetic. It displays a prominent score orb for the current assessment and provides three clear, context-aware buttons for their next step: "View Assessment Results," "View My ENNU LIFE Dashboard," and "Take Test Again."

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: The `handle_assessment_submission` method redirects to a URL like `/hair-results/?results_token=...`. The `render_thank_you_page` method (which powers the `[ennu-hair-results]` shortcode) reads the token, retrieves the results from the transient, displays them using the `templates/assessment-results.php` template, and then immediately deletes the transient. This ensures the results are shown only once, right after the assessment.

-   **Nuanced Scenarios & Edge Cases**:
    *   **Scenario**: What if a user bookmarks the tokenized results page and tries to visit it again later? **Result**: Since the transient is deleted after the first view, the `render_thank_you_page` function will find no data for the token. It will then render a graceful "empty state" message, also styled in the "Bio-Metric Canvas" aesthetic, prompting the user to visit their dashboard to see their permanent results.
    *   **Scenario**: What if a non-logged-in user clicks the "View My Dashboard" button from the results page? **Result**: The button URL is intelligently generated. The `wp_login_url()` function is used to create a link that, after a successful login, will redirect the user directly to their dashboard, providing a seamless experience.

### 5.2 The Main User Dashboard (The "Bio-Metric Canvas")

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: A logged-in user can visit their main dashboard page (powered by `[ennu-user-dashboard]`) and see a beautiful, card-based overview of every assessment they have completed that is relevant to them. The dashboard also features the **Health Optimization Map**.
-   **Intelligent Filtering**: The dashboard is now context-aware. For a male user, the Menopause assessment will not be displayed. For a female user, the ED Treatment and Testosterone assessments will not be displayed. This creates a clean, personalized, and relevant experience.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: The `render_user_dashboard` method calls `get_user_assessments_data()`. This helper method now fetches the user's gender from their profile and filters the complete list of assessments from `assessment-definitions.php` before returning the data to be rendered by the `templates/user-dashboard.php` template.

### 5.3 Feature: The Health Optimization Map

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: The dashboard prominently features the "Health Optimization Map," which has two distinct states:
    1.  **Empty State**: If the user has *not* yet completed the Health Optimization Assessment, the map card displays a clear explanation of the feature and a prominent "Start Health Optimization Assessment" button that links directly to the assessment.
    2.  **Completed State**: Once the user completes the assessment, the card transforms into a rich, interactive display. It shows a grid of every possible Health Vector (e.g., "Inflammation," "Hormones"). Within each vector, it lists all associated symptoms and biomarkers. The specific vectors, symptoms, and biomarkers triggered by the user's answers are highlighted with a vibrant, pulsating glow, drawing their attention to their personalized results.
-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: The `render_user_dashboard` function fetches the complete `health_map` from the scoring engine. The `user-dashboard.php` template then uses a conditional (`if ( $is_completed )`) to render either the empty state with the link or the full, interactive map with the `pulsate` class applied to highlighted items.

## 6.0 For Administrators: Managing and Interpreting Assessment Data

This section details the powerful tools available to the site administrator, transforming the WordPress backend into a true Health Intelligence Dashboard.

### 6.1 How to Access User Assessment Data

1.  Navigate to **Users** in your WordPress admin sidebar.
2.  Click on the username of the user you wish to review.
3.  Scroll down past the standard WordPress profile fields. You will find a new section titled **"Health Intelligence Dashboard"**.

This dashboard is the central hub for viewing all of a single user's assessment activities.

### 6.2 Feature: The Admin Health Dashboard

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: When an administrator edits a user's profile in the WordPress admin, they see a comprehensive "Health Intelligence Dashboard" section. This section provides a complete, at-a-glance overview of the user's health assessment journey. It contains a tabbed interface, allowing the administrator to easily switch between the different assessments the user has taken (Hair, Skin, Weight Loss, etc.).

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: The `ENNU_Enhanced_Admin` class is responsible for this. The `show_user_assessment_fields` method is hooked to `show_user_profile` and `edit_user_profile` (from the central `ennu-life-plugin.php` controller). This method renders the main dashboard view, which includes the user's overall health score and the tabbed interface for each assessment.

-   **Nuanced Scenarios & Edge Cases**:
    -   **Scenario**: What if the user has no assessment data at all? **Result**: The code gracefully handles this. The `get_user_assessment_history` call will return empty, and the dashboard will simply show "No data available," preventing any errors. The tabs for each assessment will still be present, but they will show empty states for all the questions.
    -   **Scenario**: How is the performance managed with many users and many assessments? **Result**: This was the purpose of the critical N+1 query fix. The `get_user_assessment_history` method now primes the WordPress meta cache with a single database call (`get_user_meta($user_id)`). All subsequent calls within the loops are served from memory, ensuring the admin page loads almost instantly, regardless of the amount of data. This is a crucial and perfected optimization.

### 6.3 Feature: Detailed Answer Viewing and Editing

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: Within the Admin Health Dashboard, an administrator can click on the tab for a specific assessment (e.g., "Hair Assessment"). This reveals every question from that assessment, with the user's exact answer pre-selected in an interactive field (radio button, checkbox, etc.). The administrator can change these answers and save them by clicking the "Update Profile" button at the bottom of the page.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: This is the core function of `show_user_assessment_fields`. It loops through the question configuration from `assessment-questions.php` and for each question, it fetches the corresponding user meta value. It then renders the correct HTML input field with the user's saved answer as the `value` or `checked` state. The `save_user_assessment_fields` method, hooked to `personal_options_update` and `edit_user_profile_update`, handles the saving of any changes made by the admin.

-   **Nuanced Scenarios & Edge Cases**:
    -   **Scenario**: What if an admin changes a user's answer? Does this update their score? **Result**: No, and this is by design. The admin view is for data correction and reference only. The score is only calculated at the moment of user submission via the frontend form. This prevents administrators from inadvertently changing a user's health score without their knowledge, preserving the integrity of the historical record. Any change made by an admin is simply a change to the stored answer data.
    -   **Scenario**: How does the system handle multi-select (checkbox) answers in the admin? **Result**: The `save_user_assessment_fields` method correctly handles incoming data as an array. It does not `sanitize_text_field`, which would destroy the array. It saves the array directly to the user meta, ensuring that multiple selections are preserved perfectly, whether they are saved from the frontend or the backend.

## 7.0 For Developers: Customization & Extensibility

While the plugin is designed to be a perfect, out-of-the-box solution, it has also been architected to allow for deep customization and extension by developers, following WordPress best practices.

### 7.1 Overriding Frontend Templates

The plugin's user-facing HTML output (dashboards, results pages, etc.) is managed through template files located in the `/templates/` directory of the plugin. You should **never edit these files directly**, as your changes would be lost during a plugin update.

Instead, you can override these templates from within your theme:

1.  Create a new folder in your active theme's directory named `ennu-life`.
2.  Copy the template file you wish to modify from `/wp-content/plugins/ennulifeassessments/templates/` into your new `/wp-content/themes/your-theme/ennu-life/` directory.
3.  Modify the copied template file. WordPress will now use your version instead of the plugin's default.

For example, to customize the User Dashboard, you would copy `user-dashboard.php` to `your-theme/ennu-life/user-dashboard.php` and edit it there.

This allows for unlimited visual customization while maintaining a clean separation from the core plugin logic.

### 7.2 Key Action and Filter Hooks

For extending the plugin's functionality, several key hooks are available.

*   **`ennu_before_assessment_form`**
    *   **Type**: Action
    *   **Location**: Fires right before the opening `<form>` tag of an assessment.
    *   **Use Case**: Add custom wrappers, introductory text, or tracking scripts before a form.

*   **`ennu_after_assessment_form`**
    *   **Type**: Action
    *   **Location**: Fires right after the closing `</form>` tag of an assessment.
    *   **Use Case**: Add custom legal disclaimers or related content after a form.

*   **`ennu_assessment_submission_success`**
    *   **Type**: Action
    *   **Arguments**: `$user_id`, `$assessment_type`, `$form_data`
    *   **Location**: Fires after all data has been saved and scores have been calculated for a successful submission.
    *   **Use Case**: Trigger third-party integrations, such as sending data to a CRM, adding the user to a specific mailing list, or firing a custom analytics event.

*   **`ennu_assessment_scoring_result`**
    *   **Type**: Filter
    *   **Arguments**: `$scores` (array), `$form_data` (array), `$assessment_type` (string)
    *   **Location**: Applied to the final calculated scores before they are saved to user meta.
    *   **Use Case**: Add custom scoring logic or modify existing scores based on external factors (e.g., apply a "bonus" point if the user is part of a specific user group).

---

## 8.0 Data Privacy and Security

The ENNU Life Assessment plugin handles user data with care, following standard WordPress security practices.

*   **Data Storage**: All user answers and calculated scores are stored in the standard WordPress `usermeta` table. Data is associated directly with a `user_id`. There are no custom tables created by this plugin, ensuring compatibility with standard WordPress data export and management tools.
*   **Data Access**: User data is only accessible in three ways:
    1.  By the logged-in user themselves via the frontend dashboard and results pages.
    2.  By site administrators via the "Health Intelligence Dashboard" on a user's profile screen.
    3.  By developers through custom code using standard WordPress functions like `get_user_meta()`.
*   **Security**: All frontend form submissions are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks using WordPress nonces. All data is sanitized and validated appropriately on the backend before being saved to the database.

## 9.0 Shortcode Reference: The Building Blocks of the Experience

This section provides a definitive reference for every shortcode available in the ENNU Life Assessment Plugin.

### 9.1 Assessment Form Shortcodes

These shortcodes are used to render the main, multi-step assessment forms on any page or post.

*   `[ennu-hair-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete Hair Health Assessment form.

*   `[ennu-skin-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete Skin Health Assessment form.

*   `[ennu-ed-treatment-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete ED Treatment Assessment form.

*   `[ennu-weight-loss-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete Weight Loss Assessment form.

*   `[ennu-health-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete General Health Assessment form.

### 9.2 User Account & Results Shortcodes

These shortcodes render the pages that are part of the user's journey after completing an assessment.

*   `[ennu-user-dashboard]`
    *   **Renders**: The main user dashboard. If the user is not logged in, it will show a login prompt. If the user is logged in, it displays a card for each of the five core assessments. Each card shows the user's most recent score for that assessment and a link to the detailed results page. If an assessment has not been taken, it shows a "Start Now" button.

*   `[ennu-assessment-results]`
    *   **Renders**: This is a generic results page container. It's intended to be used on a single, dedicated "Results" page. Immediately after an assessment is submitted, the user is redirected here. The page will display a detailed, one-time summary of the assessment they *just* completed. This data is held in a temporary transient and is deleted after being displayed once. If a user visits this page directly without having just completed an assessment, it will show a message prompting them to view their results on their main dashboard.

### 9.3 Detailed Results Page Shortcodes (The Health Dossier)

These shortcodes are used on dedicated pages to display the full, permanent results for a specific assessment. These are the pages linked to from the `[ennu-user-dashboard]`.

*   `[ennu-hair-assessment-details]`
*   `[ennu-skin-assessment-details]`
*   `[ennu-ed-treatment-assessment-details]`
*   `[ennu-weight-loss-assessment-details]`
*   `[ennu-health-assessment-details]`
    *   **Renders**: A comprehensive, visually rich "Health Dossier" for the specified assessment. This includes a historical score timeline, a breakdown of scores by category (e.g., "Genetic Factors", "Lifestyle Factors"), and other personalized data visualizations. It requires the user to be logged in to view the content.

---

## 10.0 Data Architecture: Saving & Utilization

This section explains precisely how data is captured, stored, and used throughout the plugin's ecosystem, from form submission to admin review.

### 10.1 Data Capture and Sanitization

1.  **Submission**: A user submits a form via an AJAX request to the `handle_assessment_submission` method.
2.  **Security Check**: The first step is a security check using a WordPress nonce to prevent CSRF attacks.
3.  **Sanitization**: All incoming data from the `$_POST` array is passed through the `sanitize_assessment_data` method. This method iterates through the data and applies the appropriate WordPress sanitization function based on the question type (e.g., `sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_email`, `is_array`). This ensures no malicious data can be saved to the database.

### 10.2 Data Storage in `usermeta`

The plugin exclusively uses the standard WordPress `usermeta` table for all data storage. No custom tables are created. This ensures maximum compatibility and data portability.

There are two primary types of meta keys used:

*   **Global Meta Keys**: These store data that can be shared across multiple assessments. They follow the pattern `ennu_global_{key}`.
    *   Examples: `ennu_global_contact_info_first_name`, `ennu_global_contact_info_last_name`, `ennu_global_contact_info_email`, `ennu_global_gender`.
    *   When a user fills out their name in one assessment, it is saved to this global key and can be pre-populated in other assessments.

*   **Assessment-Specific Meta Keys**: These store the answers to questions that are unique to one assessment. They follow the pattern `ennu_{assessment_type}_{question_key}`.
    *   Examples: `ennu_hair_assessment_hair_q2` (for "What are your primary hair concerns?"), `ennu_skin_assessment_skin_q1` (for "What is your skin type?").
    *   This ensures that the answer data for different assessments is perfectly isolated and does not conflict.

*   **Historical Score Data**: For each assessment, a historical record of all scores is maintained in a single meta key.
    *   Example: `ennu_hair_assessment_historical_scores`.
    *   This key stores a PHP serialized array. Each time a user completes the assessment, a new entry is added to this array containing the `overall_score`, `category_scores`, and a `timestamp`. This is the data source for the timeline charts on the Health Dossier pages.

### 10.3 Data Utilization

*   **On the Frontend**: The various dashboard and results page templates use standard WordPress functions (`get_user_meta`) to retrieve the saved data and render it for the user.
*   **In the Backend**: The "Health Intelligence Dashboard" on the user profile screen uses the exact same `get_user_meta` functions to retrieve and display the data for administrators. Because of the N+1 query fix, the `get_user_meta($user_id)` call is made once per page load, which primes the WordPress object cache. All subsequent requests for that user's meta on that page are served instantly from memory, ensuring high performance.

## 11.0 The Scoring System: A Deep Dive

The plugin's scoring system is designed to be both simple in its mechanics and powerful in its insights. It is a weighted point system.

### 11.1 The Scoring Engine: `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring`

The entire scoring logic is contained within the `includes/class-scoring-system.php` file. The primary method is `calculate_scores($assessment_type, $responses)`.

### 11.2 The Core Calculation Logic

1.  **Load Configuration**: The calculation begins by loading the master scoring array from `includes/config/assessment-scoring.php`.
2.  **Map Question ID to Semantic Key**: For each user response (e.g., from `hair_q2`), the system first calls `ENNU_Question_Mapper::get_semantic_key()` to translate the question ID into its meaningful key (e.g., `hair_concerns`). This is the crucial decoupling step.
3.  **Iterate Over User Responses**: The system loops through each answer the user submitted.
4.  **Map Answer to Score**: For each answer, it looks up the corresponding point value in the configuration file using the semantic key. For example, for `hair_concerns`, an answer of `'receding'` maps to a score of `3`.
5.  **Calculate Total Score**: The system simply sums the point values for every answer. A higher point value generally corresponds to a more significant health concern or risk factor.
6.  **Save the Score**: The final calculated `overall_score` is saved to the user's meta data.

### 11.3 Interpreting the Final Score

The final numerical score is then mapped to a qualitative interpretation using the `get_score_interpretation($score)` method. This provides the user with immediate, color-coded feedback. The thresholds are:

*   **Needs Attention (Red)**: Score below 5.5
*   **Fair (Yellow)**: Score from 5.5 to 6.9
*   **Good (Blue)**: Score from 7.0 to 8.4
*   **Excellent (Green)**: Score 8.5 and above

### 11.4 Example Calculation: Hair Assessment

Let's trace a simplified example for the Hair Assessment.

*   **User's Answers**:
    *   Answer to question `hair_q1` is "Male"
    *   Answer to question `hair_q2` is "Receding"
    *   Answer to question `hair_q6` is "High"

*   **Mapping & Score Lookup**:
    *   `get_semantic_key('hair_assessment', 'hair_q1')` returns `'gender'`. Score for `'male'` is `2`.
    *   `get_semantic_key('hair_assessment', 'hair_q2')` returns `'hair_concerns'`. Score for `'receding'` is `3`.
    *   `get_semantic_key('hair_assessment', 'hair_q6')` returns `'stress_level'`. Score for `'high'` is `3`.

*   **Final Score Calculation**:
    *   Total Score = 2 + 3 + 3 = `8`

*   **Interpretation**:
    *   A score of `8` falls into the "Good" category.

This clear, transparent, and decoupled system ensures that scores are consistent, reproducible, and easy to maintain.
