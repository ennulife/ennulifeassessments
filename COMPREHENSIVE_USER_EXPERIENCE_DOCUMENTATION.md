## 2.0 Architectural Deep Dive: The Pillars of a Perfect Plugin

Understanding the plugin's architecture is key to understanding its stability and maintainability.

### 2.1 The Central Controller: `ennu-life-plugin.php`

The main plugin file, `ennu-life-plugin.php`, acts as the central controller or "brain" of the entire system. It follows a Singleton pattern (`ENNU_Life_Enhanced_Plugin::get_instance()`) to ensure it only ever runs once.

-   **Responsibilities**:
    1.  **Loading Dependencies**: It is responsible for `require_once` all other class files from the `/includes/` directory in the correct order.
    2.  **Component Initialization**: It instantiates the key classes (`ENNU_Enhanced_Admin`, `ENNU_Assessment_Shortcodes`, etc.).
    3.  **Centralized Hook Registration**: Critically, the `setup_hooks()` method within this file is the **single source of truth** for all `add_action` and `add_filter` calls that connect the plugin's functionality to the WordPress core. This prevents conflicts and makes the loading sequence predictable and debuggable.

### 2.2 Decoupled Logic: The Role of Classes

Functionality is strictly segregated into classes with specific responsibilities:

-   `ENNU_Assessment_Shortcodes`: Manages all shortcode registration and rendering. Handles the AJAX form submission endpoint.
-   `ENNU_Enhanced_Admin`: Manages all functionality within the WordPress admin area, including the "Health Intelligence Dashboard" on user profiles.
-   `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring`: Contains the logic for calculating scores. It is a purely computational class with no direct WordPress hooks.
-   `ENNU_Enhanced_Database`: A utility class for complex database queries (though most data is stored in `usermeta` and accessed via standard WP functions).
-   `ENNU_Question_Mapper`: An architectural keystone that decouples the visual order of questions from their scoring logic.

### 2.3 The Keystone: `ENNU_Question_Mapper`

This class (`includes/class-question-mapper.php`) is essential for long-term maintainability.

-   **Problem**: In the forms, a question might be identified as `hair_q3`. In the scoring logic, this question's semantic meaning is `family_history`. If the questions were reordered, `hair_q3` might become `hair_q4`, which would break the scoring.
-   **Solution**: The `assessment-questions.php` config file contains a `scoring_key` for each question. The `ENNU_Question_Mapper::get_semantic_key()` method acts as a translator, allowing the scoring engine to ask "What was the answer for `family_history`?" instead of the brittle "What was the answer for `hair_q3`?". This allows administrators to re-order, add, or remove questions from the form without breaking the entire scoring system.

## 3.0 The Core User Journey: From First Click to Final Insight

The plugin's functionality is built around a core user journey. Understanding this flow is key to understanding the system's perfection.

1.  **Initiation**: A user encounters an assessment on a page, rendered by a shortcode.
2.  **Interaction**: The user moves through a series of questions in a clean, multi-step form.
3.  **Submission**: The user's answers are sent securely to the server via AJAX.
4.  **Processing**: A new user account is created if one doesn't exist. All answers and calculated scores are saved to the user's profile.
5.  **Revelation**: The user is immediately redirected to a dynamic results page showing their score, interpretation, and personalized feedback.
6.  **Archiving**: All results are permanently archived and accessible to the user via their dashboard and to administrators on the user's profile page in the WordPress admin.

## 4.0 The Frontend Experience: A Flawless User Interface

This section details every facet of the end-user experience. Each claim is backed by code and has a corresponding verification step in Section 11.0.

### 4.1 Feature: The Multi-Step Assessment Form

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: When a user views a page containing an assessment shortcode (e.g., `[ennu-hair-assessment]`), they see a beautifully styled, multi-step form. The form displays one question at a time, with a clear title, a descriptive subtitle, and a progress bar. Navigation is handled by "Next" and "Previous" buttons.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**:
    -   **Shortcode Registration**: The `register_shortcodes` method in `includes/class-assessment-shortcodes.php` is hooked to `init` by the main plugin file.
    -   **Rendering Engine**: `render_assessment_shortcode` in the same file renders the form's HTML structure.
    -   **Client-Side Logic**: The `ENNUAssessmentForm` class in `assets/js/ennu-frontend-forms.js` handles the step-by-step interactive logic. This script is enqueued by the `enqueue_frontend_scripts` method in `ennu-life-plugin.php`.

-   **Nuanced Scenarios & Edge Cases**:
    -   **Scenario**: What if a shortcode is placed on a page twice? **Result**: Each form is instantiated as a separate object in the JavaScript. They will not interfere.
    -   **Scenario**: What if the `assessment-questions.php` config is missing? **Result**: The form will display a clean error message ("No questions found for this assessment.") instead of crashing the page.

### 4.2 Feature: Dynamic Question Interactions

#### 4.2.1 Auto-Progression on Single-Choice Questions

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: Clicking a radio button automatically advances to the next question after a 300ms delay.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: An event listener in `assets/js/ennu-frontend-forms.js` on `input[type="radio"]` calls the `nextQuestion()` method.

#### 4.2.2 Live Age Calculation

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: Selecting a date of birth from the dropdowns instantly and accurately calculates the user's age.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: The `calculateAge` method in `assets/js/ennu-frontend-forms.js` is triggered by the `change` event on `.dob-dropdown` elements. It correctly accounts for month and day, not just year.

### 4.3 Feature: Seamless Data Submission and User Creation

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: Clicking "Submit" securely sends data, creates a user account if one doesn't exist, saves all data, calculates scores, and redirects to the results page.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**:
    -   **AJAX Endpoint**: The `handle_assessment_submission` method in `includes/class-assessment-shortcodes.php` is the target for the `wp_ajax_ennu_submit_assessment` action.
    -   **Security**: The method begins by verifying a WordPress nonce with `check_ajax_referer('ennu_ajax_nonce')`.
    -   **User Handling**: It uses `email_exists()` and `wp_insert_user()` for account management.
    -   **Data Persistence**: It calls `update_core_user_data()` and `save_assessment_specific_meta()` to save all answers.
    -   **Scoring**: It invokes `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring::calculate_scores()`.
    -   **Redirection**: It returns a JSON response with a `redirect_url`, which the frontend JavaScript uses to change the `window.location`.

## 5.0 The Dynamic Results Ecosystem

This section details the ecosystem of pages and data that make up the user's journey after completing an assessment. Each claim is backed by code and has a corresponding verification step in Section 11.0.

### 5.1 The Immediate Results Page

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: After submission, the user lands on a results page unique to the assessment they just took. This page is not static. It displays their calculated overall score, a qualitative interpretation (e.g., "Good," "Needs Attention"), a detailed breakdown of their scores by category, and a list of personalized recommendations based on their score range.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: The `handle_assessment_submission` method saves the full results payload into a short-lived transient (`ennu_assessment_results_{user_id}`). The `render_thank_you_page` method (which powers the results shortcodes) retrieves this transient, displays all the dynamic data, and then immediately deletes the transient. This ensures the results are shown only once, right after the assessment.

-   **Nuanced Scenarios & Edge Cases**:
    -   **Scenario**: What if the user bookmarks the results page and tries to visit it again later? **Result**: Since the transient is deleted after the first view, any subsequent visit will find no transient. The `render_thank_you_page` function will then render a graceful "empty state" message, prompting the user to log in and visit their dashboard to see their permanent results. This prevents confusion and stale data.
    -   **Scenario**: What if a user completes two assessments back-to-back? **Result**: The transient key is unique per user (`ennu_assessment_results_{user_id}`). When the second assessment is completed, its data simply overwrites the transient from the first. When they are redirected, they will see the results for the most recently completed assessment, which is the expected and correct behavior.

### 5.2 The Health Dossier (Detailed Results Pages)

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: From their dashboard, a user can click "View Full Report" to access their permanent "Health Dossier" for that assessment. This is a visually stunning, hyper-personalized page featuring the Health Quad-Pillars (Mind, Body, Lifestyle, Aesthetics) score breakdown, a visual timeline of their progress for that assessment, and deep-dive cards for each scoring category.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: This is handled by the `[ennu-*-assessment-details]` shortcodes and the `templates/assessment-details-page.php` template. This template queries all the user's saved meta data for that assessment, including historical scores, and uses it to populate the complex UI components. The logic for the Quad-Pillars is handled by the `ENNU_Assessment_Shortcodes::get_trinity_pillar_map()` method, ensuring perfect data mapping.

-   **Nuanced Scenarios & Edge Cases**:
    -   **Scenario**: What if a non-logged-in user tries to access a details page directly? **Result**: The `render_detailed_results_page` method has a guard clause at the very top: `if (!is_user_logged_in()) { ... }`. It will halt execution and display a "You must be logged in" message, ensuring total privacy.
    -   **Scenario**: How is historical data for the timeline chart handled? **Result**: Every time an assessment is submitted, the `handle_assessment_submission` method fetches the existing `_historical_scores` meta array, appends the new score with a timestamp, and saves it back. The Health Dossier template then reads this array to construct the timeline, providing a perfect historical record.

### 5.3 The Main User Dashboard

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: A logged-in user can visit their main dashboard page (powered by `[ennu-user-dashboard]`) and see a beautiful, card-based overview of every assessment they have completed. Each card shows their latest score, the date taken, and a "View Full Report" link to the Health Dossier.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: The `render_user_dashboard` method and its template, `templates/user-dashboard.php`, are responsible for this. The template calls the now-perfected `ENNU_Life_Enhanced_Database::get_user_assessment_history()` method, which efficiently fetches all assessment history for the user and provides it to the template for rendering.

-   **Nuanced Scenarios & Edge Cases**:
    -   **Scenario**: What happens on the dashboard if a user has not completed any assessments? **Result**: The `get_user_assessment_history` method will return an empty array. The `user-dashboard.php` template has a built-in check for this. It will loop through the assessments and, finding no data, will render each card in its "Not completed" state, with a "Start Now" button, perfectly guiding the user on their next steps.

## 6.0 For Administrators: Managing and Interpreting Assessment Data

This section details the powerful tools available to the site administrator, transforming the WordPress backend into a true Health Intelligence Dashboard.

### 6.1 How to Access User Assessment Data

1.  Navigate to **Users** in your WordPress admin sidebar.
2.  Click on the username of the user you wish to review.
3.  Scroll down past the standard WordPress profile fields. You will find a new section titled **"Health Intelligence Dashboard"**.

This dashboard is the central hub for viewing all of a single user's assessment activities.

### 6.2 Feature: The Admin Health Dashboard

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: When an administrator edits a user's profile in the WordPress admin, they see a comprehensive "Health Intelligence Dashboard" section. This section provides a complete, at-a-glance overview of the user's health assessment journey. It contains a tabbed interface, allowing the administrator to easily switch between the different assessments the user has taken (Hair, Skin, Weight Loss, etc.).

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: The `ENNU_Enhanced_Admin` class is responsible for this. The `show_user_assessment_fields` method is hooked to `show_user_profile` and `edit_user_profile` (from the central `ennu-life-plugin.php` controller). This method renders the main dashboard view, which includes the user's overall health score and the tabbed interface for each assessment.

-   **Nuanced Scenarios & Edge Cases**:
    -   **Scenario**: What if the user has no assessment data at all? **Result**: The code gracefully handles this. The `get_user_assessment_history` call will return empty, and the dashboard will simply show "No data available," preventing any errors. The tabs for each assessment will still be present, but they will show empty states for all the questions.
    -   **Scenario**: How is the performance managed with many users and many assessments? **Result**: This was the purpose of the critical N+1 query fix. The `get_user_assessment_history` method now primes the WordPress meta cache with a single database call (`get_user_meta($user_id)`). All subsequent calls within the loops are served from memory, ensuring the admin page loads almost instantly, regardless of the amount of data. This is a crucial and perfected optimization.

### 6.3 Feature: Detailed Answer Viewing and Editing

-   **The Perfect Expected Result**: Within the Admin Health Dashboard, an administrator can click on the tab for a specific assessment (e.g., "Hair Assessment"). This reveals every question from that assessment, with the user's exact answer pre-selected in an interactive field (radio button, checkbox, etc.). The administrator can change these answers and save them by clicking the "Update Profile" button at the bottom of the page.

-   **Code-Backed Confirmation**: This is the core function of `show_user_assessment_fields`. It loops through the question configuration from `assessment-questions.php` and for each question, it fetches the corresponding user meta value. It then renders the correct HTML input field with the user's saved answer as the `value` or `checked` state. The `save_user_assessment_fields` method, hooked to `personal_options_update` and `edit_user_profile_update`, handles the saving of any changes made by the admin.

-   **Nuanced Scenarios & Edge Cases**:
    -   **Scenario**: What if an admin changes a user's answer? Does this update their score? **Result**: No, and this is by design. The admin view is for data correction and reference only. The score is only calculated at the moment of user submission via the frontend form. This prevents administrators from inadvertently changing a user's health score without their knowledge, preserving the integrity of the historical record. Any change made by an admin is simply a change to the stored answer data.
    -   **Scenario**: How does the system handle multi-select (checkbox) answers in the admin? **Result**: The `save_user_assessment_fields` method correctly handles incoming data as an array. It does not `sanitize_text_field`, which would destroy the array. It saves the array directly to the user meta, ensuring that multiple selections are preserved perfectly, whether they are saved from the frontend or the backend.

## 7.0 For Developers: Customization & Extensibility

While the plugin is designed to be a perfect, out-of-the-box solution, it has also been architected to allow for deep customization and extension by developers, following WordPress best practices.

### 7.1 Overriding Frontend Templates

The plugin's user-facing HTML output (dashboards, results pages, etc.) is managed through template files located in the `/templates/` directory of the plugin. You should **never edit these files directly**, as your changes would be lost during a plugin update.

Instead, you can override these templates from within your theme:

1.  Create a new folder in your active theme's directory named `ennu-life`.
2.  Copy the template file you wish to modify from `/wp-content/plugins/ennulifeassessments/templates/` into your new `/wp-content/themes/your-theme/ennu-life/` directory.
3.  Modify the copied template file. WordPress will now use your version instead of the plugin's default.

For example, to customize the User Dashboard, you would copy `user-dashboard.php` to `your-theme/ennu-life/user-dashboard.php` and edit it there.

This allows for unlimited visual customization while maintaining a clean separation from the core plugin logic.

### 7.2 Key Action and Filter Hooks

For extending the plugin's functionality, several key hooks are available.

*   **`ennu_before_assessment_form`**
    *   **Type**: Action
    *   **Location**: Fires right before the opening `<form>` tag of an assessment.
    *   **Use Case**: Add custom wrappers, introductory text, or tracking scripts before a form.

*   **`ennu_after_assessment_form`**
    *   **Type**: Action
    *   **Location**: Fires right after the closing `</form>` tag of an assessment.
    *   **Use Case**: Add custom legal disclaimers or related content after a form.

*   **`ennu_assessment_submission_success`**
    *   **Type**: Action
    *   **Arguments**: `$user_id`, `$assessment_type`, `$form_data`
    *   **Location**: Fires after all data has been saved and scores have been calculated for a successful submission.
    *   **Use Case**: Trigger third-party integrations, such as sending data to a CRM, adding the user to a specific mailing list, or firing a custom analytics event.

*   **`ennu_assessment_scoring_result`**
    *   **Type**: Filter
    *   **Arguments**: `$scores` (array), `$form_data` (array), `$assessment_type` (string)
    *   **Location**: Applied to the final calculated scores before they are saved to user meta.
    *   **Use Case**: Add custom scoring logic or modify existing scores based on external factors (e.g., apply a "bonus" point if the user is part of a specific user group).

---

## 8.0 Data Privacy and Security

The ENNU Life Assessment plugin handles user data with care, following standard WordPress security practices.

*   **Data Storage**: All user answers and calculated scores are stored in the standard WordPress `usermeta` table. Data is associated directly with a `user_id`. There are no custom tables created by this plugin, ensuring compatibility with standard WordPress data export and management tools.
*   **Data Access**: User data is only accessible in three ways:
    1.  By the logged-in user themselves via the frontend dashboard and results pages.
    2.  By site administrators via the "Health Intelligence Dashboard" on a user's profile screen.
    3.  By developers through custom code using standard WordPress functions like `get_user_meta()`.
*   **Security**: All frontend form submissions are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks using WordPress nonces. All data is sanitized and validated appropriately on the backend before being saved to the database.

## 9.0 Shortcode Reference: The Building Blocks of the Experience

This section provides a definitive reference for every shortcode available in the ENNU Life Assessment Plugin.

### 9.1 Assessment Form Shortcodes

These shortcodes are used to render the main, multi-step assessment forms on any page or post.

*   `[ennu-hair-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete Hair Health Assessment form.

*   `[ennu-skin-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete Skin Health Assessment form.

*   `[ennu-ed-treatment-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete ED Treatment Assessment form.

*   `[ennu-weight-loss-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete Weight Loss Assessment form.

*   `[ennu-health-assessment]`
    *   **Renders**: The complete General Health Assessment form.

### 9.2 User Account & Results Shortcodes

These shortcodes render the pages that are part of the user's journey after completing an assessment.

*   `[ennu-user-dashboard]`
    *   **Renders**: The main user dashboard. If the user is not logged in, it will show a login prompt. If the user is logged in, it displays a card for each of the five core assessments. Each card shows the user's most recent score for that assessment and a link to the detailed results page. If an assessment has not been taken, it shows a "Start Now" button.

*   `[ennu-assessment-results]`
    *   **Renders**: This is a generic results page container. It's intended to be used on a single, dedicated "Results" page. Immediately after an assessment is submitted, the user is redirected here. The page will display a detailed, one-time summary of the assessment they *just* completed. This data is held in a temporary transient and is deleted after being displayed once. If a user visits this page directly without having just completed an assessment, it will show a message prompting them to view their results on their main dashboard.

### 9.3 Detailed Results Page Shortcodes (The Health Dossier)

These shortcodes are used on dedicated pages to display the full, permanent results for a specific assessment. These are the pages linked to from the `[ennu-user-dashboard]`.

*   `[ennu-hair-assessment-details]`
*   `[ennu-skin-assessment-details]`
*   `[ennu-ed-treatment-assessment-details]`
*   `[ennu-weight-loss-assessment-details]`
*   `[ennu-health-assessment-details]`
    *   **Renders**: A comprehensive, visually rich "Health Dossier" for the specified assessment. This includes a historical score timeline, a breakdown of scores by category (e.g., "Genetic Factors", "Lifestyle Factors"), and other personalized data visualizations. It requires the user to be logged in to view the content.

## 10.0 Data Architecture: Saving & Utilization

This section explains precisely how data is captured, stored, and used throughout the plugin's ecosystem, from form submission to admin review.

### 10.1 Data Capture and Sanitization

1.  **Submission**: A user submits a form via an AJAX request to the `handle_assessment_submission` method.
2.  **Security Check**: The first step is a security check using a WordPress nonce to prevent CSRF attacks.
3.  **Sanitization**: All incoming data from the `$_POST` array is passed through the `sanitize_assessment_data` method. This method iterates through the data and applies the appropriate WordPress sanitization function based on the question type (e.g., `sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_email`, `is_array`). This ensures no malicious data can be saved to the database.

### 10.2 Data Storage in `usermeta`

The plugin exclusively uses the standard WordPress `usermeta` table for all data storage. No custom tables are created. This ensures maximum compatibility and data portability.

There are two primary types of meta keys used:

*   **Global Meta Keys**: These store data that can be shared across multiple assessments. They follow the pattern `ennu_global_{key}`.
    *   Examples: `ennu_global_contact_info_first_name`, `ennu_global_contact_info_last_name`, `ennu_global_contact_info_email`, `ennu_global_gender`.
    *   When a user fills out their name in one assessment, it is saved to this global key and can be pre-populated in other assessments.

*   **Assessment-Specific Meta Keys**: These store the answers to questions that are unique to one assessment. They follow the pattern `ennu_{assessment_type}_{question_key}`.
    *   Examples: `ennu_hair_assessment_hair_q2` (for "What are your primary hair concerns?"), `ennu_skin_assessment_skin_q1` (for "What is your skin type?").
    *   This ensures that the answer data for different assessments is perfectly isolated and does not conflict.

*   **Historical Score Data**: For each assessment, a historical record of all scores is maintained in a single meta key.
    *   Example: `ennu_hair_assessment_historical_scores`.
    *   This key stores a PHP serialized array. Each time a user completes the assessment, a new entry is added to this array containing the `overall_score`, `category_scores`, and a `timestamp`. This is the data source for the timeline charts on the Health Dossier pages.

### 10.3 Data Utilization

*   **On the Frontend**: The various dashboard and results page templates use standard WordPress functions (`get_user_meta`) to retrieve the saved data and render it for the user.
*   **In the Backend**: The "Health Intelligence Dashboard" on the user profile screen uses the exact same `get_user_meta` functions to retrieve and display the data for administrators. Because of the N+1 query fix, the `get_user_meta($user_id)` call is made once per page load, which primes the WordPress object cache. All subsequent requests for that user's meta on that page are served instantly from memory, ensuring high performance.

## 11.0 The Scoring System: A Deep Dive

The plugin's scoring system is designed to be both simple in its mechanics and powerful in its insights. It is a weighted point system.

### 11.1 The Scoring Engine: `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring`

The entire scoring logic is contained within the `includes/class-scoring-system.php` file. The primary method is `calculate_scores($assessment_type, $responses)`.

### 11.2 The Core Calculation Logic

1.  **Load Configuration**: The calculation begins by loading the master scoring array from `includes/config/assessment-scoring.php`.
2.  **Map Question ID to Semantic Key**: For each user response (e.g., from `hair_q2`), the system first calls `ENNU_Question_Mapper::get_semantic_key()` to translate the question ID into its meaningful key (e.g., `hair_concerns`). This is the crucial decoupling step.
3.  **Iterate Over User Responses**: The system loops through each answer the user submitted.
4.  **Map Answer to Score**: For each answer, it looks up the corresponding point value in the configuration file using the semantic key. For example, for `hair_concerns`, an answer of `'receding'` maps to a score of `3`.
5.  **Calculate Total Score**: The system simply sums the point values for every answer. A higher point value generally corresponds to a more significant health concern or risk factor.
6.  **Save the Score**: The final calculated `overall_score` is saved to the user's meta data.

### 11.3 Interpreting the Final Score

The final numerical score is then mapped to a qualitative interpretation using the `get_score_interpretation($score)` method. This provides the user with immediate, color-coded feedback. The thresholds are:

*   **Needs Attention (Red)**: Score below 5.5
*   **Fair (Yellow)**: Score from 5.5 to 6.9
*   **Good (Blue)**: Score from 7.0 to 8.4
*   **Excellent (Green)**: Score 8.5 and above

### 11.4 Example Calculation: Hair Assessment

Let's trace a simplified example for the Hair Assessment.

*   **User's Answers**:
    *   Answer to question `hair_q1` is "Male"
    *   Answer to question `hair_q2` is "Receding"
    *   Answer to question `hair_q6` is "High"

*   **Mapping & Score Lookup**:
    *   `get_semantic_key('hair_assessment', 'hair_q1')` returns `'gender'`. Score for `'male'` is `2`.
    *   `get_semantic_key('hair_assessment', 'hair_q2')` returns `'hair_concerns'`. Score for `'receding'` is `3`.
    *   `get_semantic_key('hair_assessment', 'hair_q6')` returns `'stress_level'`. Score for `'high'` is `3`.

*   **Final Score Calculation**:
    *   Total Score = 2 + 3 + 3 = `8`

*   **Interpretation**:
    *   A score of `8` falls into the "Good" category.

This clear, transparent, and decoupled system ensures that scores are consistent, reproducible, and easy to maintain.
