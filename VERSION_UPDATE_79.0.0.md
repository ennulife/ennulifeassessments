### Enhanced Assessment Modal Experience

- **Improved Timing**: Extended modal duration with proper success feedback before redirect
- **Bulletproof Navigation**: Sequential processing ensures modal completion before results page navigation

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Target Calculation Logic
```php
// Evidence-based progressive improvement algorithm
function calculate_individual_target($current_score) {
    if ($current_score == 0) {
        return 3.0; // Initial goal for new users
    } elseif ($current_score < 3.0) {
        return min(5.0, $current_score + 2.0); // Large improvement potential
    } elseif ($current_score < 6.0) {
        return min(7.5, $current_score + 1.5); // Moderate growth goals
    } elseif ($current_score < 8.0) {
        return min(9.0, $current_score + 1.0); // Steady progress
    } else {
        return min(10.0, $current_score + 0.5); // Fine-tuning for high performers
    }
}
```

### Modal Messaging System
```javascript
// Dynamic content based on user status
const headerTitle = isLoggedIn 
    ? "Processing Your Assessment" 
    : "Creating Your Personalized Health Profile";

const step1Title = isLoggedIn 
    ? "Validating Your Responses" 
    : "Creating Your Account";
```

### Redirect Flow Optimization
```javascript
// Sequential processing ensures proper user experience
if (progressModal) {
    // Complete modal animation
    this.updateProgressModal(progressModal, 5);
    
    // Wait for success message visibility
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.removeProgressModal(progressModal);
        // Redirect after modal completion
        window.location.href = redirectUrl;
    }, 1500);
}
```
