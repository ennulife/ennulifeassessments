### 3. Security Audit Logger (`class-security-audit-logger.php`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security event logging and monitoring

**Monitored Events**:
- Authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
- Administrative actions (role changes, plugin activation)
- Security events (threats detected, IPs blocked)
- Data access events (sensitive data access, exports)
- System events (file modifications, database errors)

**Log Levels**:
- CRITICAL: Immediate attention required
- HIGH: Important security events
- MEDIUM: Notable events requiring monitoring
- LOW: Informational events
- INFO: General activity logging

**Features**:
- Automatic log retention (90 days default)
- Email alerts for critical events
- Export capabilities (CSV, JSON)
- Advanced filtering and search
- Database optimization with indexed fields

### 4. Security Admin Interface (`class-security-admin-interface.php`)
**Purpose**: Administrative dashboard for security management

**Dashboard Tabs**:
- **Dashboard**: Security statistics and recent events
- **Blocked IPs**: IP management and blocking controls
- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive log viewing and filtering
- **Settings**: Rate limits and security feature configuration
- **Two-Factor Auth**: 2FA management and user statistics

**Quick Actions**:
- Export audit logs (CSV/JSON)
- Clear old logs
- Run security scan
- Block/unblock IP addresses
- Update rate limits

## Security Enhancements

### Database Security
- **New Tables**: 
  - `wp_ennu_security_log`: Security event logging

- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking security checks

## Configuration Options

### Rate Limiting Settings
```php
$rate_limits = array(
    'login_attempts' => 5,      // Per minute
    'api_requests' => 60,       // Per minute
    'form_submissions' => 10,   // Per minute
    'ajax_requests' => 30,      // Per minute
    'assessment_submissions' => 3 // Per minute
);
```

### Security Features Toggle
```php
$security_settings = array(
    'enable_2fa' => true,
    'enable_audit_logging' => true,
    'enable_threat_detection' => true,
    'email_critical_only' => true
);
```
