0:0:5.61 --> 0:0:8.581
Luis Escobar
Sure. Let me start, I guess by sharing putting up those notes.
0:0:12.561 --> 0:0:25.761
Luis Escobar
You know the the right now what I was able to like do over the last, you know, 24 hours is they were like extract all the you know existing content that you have inside of your your website on WordPress right.
0:0:26.651 --> 0:0:28.611
Luis Escobar
And just do a little.
0:0:30.241 --> 0:0:42.481
Luis Escobar
Also extraction of like some of the custom fields you have in there, some of the user flows, some of the engagements you have try to like come together with like a new approach for the website, right?
0:0:43.641 --> 0:0:46.921
Luis Escobar
I did like the the fake news that that Brian provided, right.
0:0:46.921 --> 0:0:49.41
Luis Escobar
So I also use that as a nice reference.
0:0:50.801 --> 0:0:53.921
Luis Escobar
I did begin doing some competitive research.
0:0:54.281 --> 0:0:56.161
Luis Escobar
I think more on the the national level.
0:0:57.511 --> 0:1:2.431
Luis Escobar
Share the document there. That compares the new to live course.
0:1:2.471 --> 0:1:5.951
Luis Escobar
And then there's another one that compares the new to.
0:1:7.481 --> 0:1:9.361
Luis Escobar
All right. My life force to ten of its competitors.
0:1:12.301 --> 0:1:14.301
Luis Escobar
Where that came across also.
0:1:20.301 --> 0:1:20.781
Basement
I didn't.
0:1:21.181 --> 0:1:22.221
Basement
I didn't get that.
0:1:22.221 --> 0:1:23.101
Basement
Did you get that?
0:1:24.911 --> 0:1:26.671
Basement
I saw it, but I don't.
0:1:26.671 --> 0:1:28.31
Basement
Who did you send that to?
0:1:29.601 --> 0:1:30.881
Luis Escobar
I shared it on teams.
0:1:32.321 --> 0:1:34.801
Luis Escobar
In in a group that I I added a few of us too.
0:1:33.761 --> 0:1:34.321
Basement
He's.
0:1:36.641 --> 0:1:39.361
Luis Escobar
But it's fine. I'll share it again.
0:1:36.841 --> 0:1:41.521
Basement
Oh, Oh yeah, it's on teams here in the group chat. OK OK.
0:1:43.31 --> 0:1:44.911
Basement
I'm the only one here without.
0:1:47.31 --> 0:1:47.711
Basement
A laptop.
0:1:47.991 --> 0:1:49.791
Basement
So sorry.
0:1:51.391 --> 0:1:53.911
Basement
I have a pen and 500 pieces of paper, right?
0:1:53.911 --> 0:1:55.951
Basement
I have a pen and paper.
0:1:56.71 --> 0:1:58.271
Basement
I'm killing drakes so.
0:2:1.281 --> 0:2:2.601
Luis Escobar
Gonna share my screen.
0:2:8.721 --> 0:2:9.441
Luis Escobar
That's gonna be.
0:2:23.241 --> 0:2:24.41
Basement
Hope everything is OK.
0:2:25.941 --> 0:2:26.141
Basement
Hello.
0:2:32.611 --> 0:2:33.571
Basement
Did this.
0:2:34.381 --> 0:2:35.21
Basement
Permit planning.
0:2:35.21 --> 0:2:35.901
Basement
Go on today.
0:2:37.391 --> 0:2:37.551
Basement
OK.
0:2:37.551 --> 0:2:38.591
Basement
So so you all.
0:2:39.111 --> 0:2:40.511
Basement
Who all was involved in that?
0:2:42.951 --> 0:2:56.911
Basement
Pretty much the whole marketing team, but we outlined everything, all of the main projects and then everyone's going in and adding their sub tasks and then Brian's gonna go in and put due dates in, OK. And what was Louis part of that?
0:2:57.351 --> 0:3:3.591
Basement
No, it was more of just like internal organization for what based off of what we talked about.
0:3:4.421 --> 0:3:7.261
Basement
So like the list that we made. Yeah. Yeah. OK.
0:3:7.541 --> 0:3:10.461
Basement
Yeah, I don't know if you've heard that.
0:3:10.461 --> 0:3:18.781
Basement
Have him look at it until we have like due dates and all the subtasks in and then Brian corrects me if I'm wrong.
0:3:18.781 --> 0:3:19.821
Basement
But then we were gonna.
0:3:21.471 --> 0:3:23.191
Basement
Tell Louis it was finished, right?
0:3:25.101 --> 0:3:26.221
Brian Hyatt
That's correct, yes.
0:3:26.691 --> 0:3:27.51
Basement
Yeah.
0:3:27.861 --> 0:3:32.861
Basement
Once we get like everything organized and then bring him into that conversation.
0:3:40.91 --> 0:3:42.51
Basement
But Louis, you already have access to click up.
0:3:42.51 --> 0:3:42.971
Basement
I think so.
0:3:43.171 --> 0:3:44.891
Basement
You can obviously look at it at any time.
0:3:57.221 --> 0:3:59.941
Basement
Your mic's off. Just FYI think.
0:4:7.981 --> 0:4:8.21
Brian Hyatt
S.
0:4:14.271 --> 0:4:14.751
Luis Escobar
That better.
0:4:14.751 --> 0:4:17.191
Luis Escobar
Can you hear me now? All right.
0:4:15.601 --> 0:4:16.961
Basement
Yep, Yep.
0:4:19.311 --> 0:4:22.751
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I I was inside of Clickup and I'm following along.
0:4:22.791 --> 0:4:28.71
Luis Escobar
You know, so we can do a deep dive into all those sprints.
0:4:28.71 --> 0:4:39.391
Luis Escobar
Exact I think you know, once we have this new 1.0 version of the of the site and and some of the the foundational things inside of our HubSpot, everything will come in line.
0:4:41.611 --> 0:4:45.211
Luis Escobar
What I did do is just like preliminary like research.
0:4:45.211 --> 0:4:46.291
Luis Escobar
Right on these competitors.
0:4:46.291 --> 0:4:52.91
Luis Escobar
So my life force function health inside tracker, my rec health own health. Next health.
0:4:53.671 --> 0:4:56.591
Luis Escobar
Biome Thrive Lab defi medical any of these?
0:4:59.261 --> 0:5:0.61
Luis Escobar
So familiar.
0:5:0.421 --> 0:5:3.301
Basement
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Almost all of them.
0:5:3.91 --> 0:5:3.251
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:5:4.181 --> 0:5:4.541
Luis Escobar
Great.
0:5:5.861 --> 0:5:8.861
Luis Escobar
But yeah, I mean it's it seems like these are some.
0:5:10.351 --> 0:5:12.511
Luis Escobar
National you know, a players, right?
0:5:14.191 --> 0:5:17.951
Luis Escobar
You should, you know, try to pay attention to emulate or or.
0:5:19.591 --> 0:5:22.511
Luis Escobar
See, you know what we like from them and and replicate it right there.
0:5:22.511 --> 0:5:24.631
Luis Escobar
There's a lot to like from my life force.
0:5:25.31 --> 0:5:28.151
Luis Escobar
I think we've got a few like conversations about that, right?
0:5:31.181 --> 0:5:32.941
Luis Escobar
Just down to the branding, right?
0:5:33.141 --> 0:5:35.981
Luis Escobar
And branding is something I also wanna talk about in this meeting.
0:5:37.551 --> 0:5:41.911
Luis Escobar
Theeno.cothe.co is really it's just not working.
0:5:43.901 --> 0:5:45.381
Luis Escobar
It needs to be a.com.
0:5:48.61 --> 0:5:49.941
Luis Escobar
I know you guys have several domains.
0:5:52.71 --> 0:5:57.751
Luis Escobar
I did do some some research and I found a newlife.com is available.
0:6:0.771 --> 0:6:2.411
Luis Escobar
Ennulive.com.
0:6:4.621 --> 0:6:8.701
Luis Escobar
I feel like that could be a a the main domain right now.
0:6:8.941 --> 0:6:12.541
Luis Escobar
I know one of your competitors optimize U global for example.
0:6:12.581 --> 0:6:17.421
Luis Escobar
They have their main HQ website. It seems like optimized use centers.
0:6:18.541 --> 0:6:24.781
Luis Escobar
Then they have like individual sites for each location really, which is also a very smart idea, and we should do the same.
0:6:26.791 --> 0:6:34.311
Luis Escobar
But there should be a a synergy between all the websites and and life or of course enu brings it together.
0:6:34.311 --> 0:6:36.431
Luis Escobar
It's just. Can we buy the.com?
0:6:36.431 --> 0:6:36.791
Luis Escobar
Have we?
0:6:36.951 --> 0:6:38.671
Luis Escobar
Have you guys made an attempt?
0:6:39.481 --> 0:6:45.921
Basement
Yeah, we were at around 30,000, I think, which I thought was which I thought was high, so.
0:6:43.51 --> 0:6:43.371
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:6:47.671 --> 0:6:52.231
Basement
And and quite frankly, I wasn't at that time that much in love with the name anyway.
0:6:48.211 --> 0:6:48.731
Luis Escobar
You could try.
0:6:52.231 --> 0:6:54.311
Basement
So it was kind of.
0:6:56.501 --> 0:6:57.21
Basement
Oh yeah.
0:6:58.721 --> 0:6:59.441
Luis Escobar
I don't know.
0:6:59.561 --> 0:7:1.401
Luis Escobar
I mean, I'm not against it at first.
0:7:1.401 --> 0:7:3.761
Luis Escobar
I told you, I think we need a drastic.
0:7:5.271 --> 0:7:12.271
Luis Escobar
Brand facelift, but I mean the more I thought about it the you know it's it's not bad. Actually the logo's not bad.
0:7:12.271 --> 0:7:16.391
Luis Escobar
You guys did a good job actually with the the icon design.
0:7:18.271 --> 0:7:22.471
Luis Escobar
Maybe the the color schemes need to be adjusted?
0:7:22.951 --> 0:7:27.631
Luis Escobar
Maybe the the font of the Ennu needs to be adjusted, right?
0:7:29.51 --> 0:7:40.851
Luis Escobar
So we can continue paying on this and I think adding the word life, you know it just also my life force.com is you know, I know exactly what I'm getting when I when I land on that website or just thinking about the domain.
0:7:44.111 --> 0:7:48.871
Luis Escobar
You really have to think from like a direct marketing direct to consumer perspective, right?
0:7:49.711 --> 0:7:52.271
Luis Escobar
It's it's split second decisions, right that that.
0:7:54.581 --> 0:7:57.421
Luis Escobar
My life force like it makes perfect sense.
0:7:56.991 --> 0:8:3.711
Basement
Brian, Brian. Brian, did you you have access to our domain?
0:7:58.951 --> 0:7:59.551
Luis Escobar
You know.
0:8:4.761 --> 0:8:5.841
Basement
Purchasing on.
0:8:8.671 --> 0:8:9.151
Basement
Enam.
0:8:10.941 --> 0:8:11.821
Basement
Is there something?
0:8:11.861 --> 0:8:13.421
Basement
Are you on the road now, I guess.
0:8:13.891 --> 0:8:14.291
Brian Hyatt
Yeah.
0:8:15.281 --> 0:8:20.761
Luis Escobar
So I went ahead and just bought that domain in your-life.com before anybody else does.
0:8:18.431 --> 0:8:18.871
Basement
OK.
0:8:21.431 --> 0:8:21.591
Basement
OK.
0:8:22.471 --> 0:8:24.471
Luis Escobar
I bought it through Cloudfair.
0:8:24.471 --> 0:8:25.711
Luis Escobar
Do you guys have a cloud fair account?
0:8:27.171 --> 0:8:27.651
Basement
Now.
0:8:28.471 --> 0:8:29.271
Luis Escobar
OK so.
0:8:29.451 --> 0:8:29.491
Renzo Mogrovejo
I.
0:8:29.931 --> 0:8:33.811
Renzo Mogrovejo
I created one for for tripones.
0:8:31.681 --> 0:8:32.81
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:8:34.571 --> 0:8:35.11
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:8:35.531 --> 0:8:38.171
Luis Escobar
Well, I think I'll just use this new one, right.
0:8:38.171 --> 0:8:43.891
Luis Escobar
It'll be our our main Calvert account. Calculate will service our our our DNS provider.
0:8:45.351 --> 0:8:48.471
Luis Escobar
Also help with optimizing the cyber speed and security.
0:8:45.431 --> 0:8:45.831
Renzo Mogrovejo
OK.
0:8:50.431 --> 0:8:58.711
Luis Escobar
So and then furthermore has like a really like seamless integration with Google Workspace, which is another thing I would like to establish on this call.
0:8:50.911 --> 0:8:51.551
Renzo Mogrovejo
You got it? Yeah.
0:9:0.591 --> 0:9:1.871
Luis Escobar
And the the.
0:9:3.591 --> 0:9:8.631
Luis Escobar
Hosting that, we're gonna be using just for like this initial launch, right?
0:9:9.261 --> 0:9:10.501
Luis Escobar
It's a reliable host.
0:9:12.31 --> 0:9:16.431
Luis Escobar
No, we're not gonna be, you know, launching the members portal on Friday.
0:9:16.671 --> 0:9:18.631
Luis Escobar
We don't need to be HIPAA compliant on Friday.
0:9:20.271 --> 0:9:25.431
Luis Escobar
When it comes to being HIPAA compliant, we'll we'll utilize a A HIPAA compliant server, right?
0:9:25.431 --> 0:9:27.871
Luis Escobar
But right now we're just launching this this marketing website.
0:9:31.431 --> 0:9:39.471
Luis Escobar
Ted, I think I just need to connect with someone to, to or send them the link so they can put a payment method on file.
0:9:40.361 --> 0:9:40.721
Basement
Jump.
0:9:43.421 --> 0:9:47.181
Basement
Just send out the Trent or myself.
0:9:49.61 --> 0:9:49.781
Luis Escobar
OK, on it.
0:9:53.781 --> 0:10:0.781
Luis Escobar
And the other thing is, I started drafting a few ideas of mockups for what the website can look like.
0:10:10.41 --> 0:10:14.641
Basement
In a world so competitive.
0:10:16.711 --> 0:10:24.911
Basement
You know, you were able to instantly see 15 different folks that that all purport.
0:10:25.31 --> 0:10:30.151
Basement
I mean, the biggest concern is how do we stand out, right?
0:10:30.151 --> 0:10:32.631
Basement
I mean like 'cause we we are not.
0:10:34.391 --> 0:10:37.511
Basement
Life force. You know, we're we're not them.
0:10:37.901 --> 0:10:40.821
Basement
I mean, we do so much more.
0:10:42.831 --> 0:10:48.31
Basement
So, so, but yet people may not care that we do more.
0:10:49.711 --> 0:10:52.311
Basement
People you know, so I really need your take on that.
0:10:54.431 --> 0:10:55.71
Basement
Yeah. So.
0:10:54.991 --> 0:11:1.191
Luis Escobar
Yeah. No, I mean the the fact that you guys do more is actually it should make it easier to to stand out, right?
0:11:1.591 --> 0:11:4.951
Luis Escobar
However, sometimes less is more, right?
0:11:5.631 --> 0:11:11.591
Luis Escobar
So we really gotta dial in our, our, our messaging, right.
0:11:14.341 --> 0:11:25.901
Luis Escobar
Not just the the logo, the domain, but like the the catch phrase. The the mission statement, the every word on this website needs to be really well thought out.
0:11:27.711 --> 0:11:30.351
Luis Escobar
You know, the copywriters are like some of the unsung heroes.
0:11:30.471 --> 0:11:32.511
Luis Escobar
I mean, AI is really good right now.
0:11:32.511 --> 0:11:34.71
Luis Escobar
I'm not gonna lie, but.
0:11:36.1 --> 0:11:41.201
Luis Escobar
Have a person with copywriting background behind AI is is that really brilliant?
0:11:36.421 --> 0:11:36.581
Basement
OK.
0:11:43.421 --> 0:11:46.381
Luis Escobar
Just putting together, you know the right words, right?
0:11:46.541 --> 0:11:47.461
Luis Escobar
Not too much, not too little.
0:11:50.181 --> 0:11:51.821
Luis Escobar
You know, we, I know you guys offer a lot.
0:11:51.821 --> 0:11:53.541
Luis Escobar
It's it's a ton, which is great actually.
0:11:53.541 --> 0:11:56.701
Luis Escobar
It's gonna do wonders for our our SEO, right?
0:11:56.701 --> 0:12:3.501
Luis Escobar
Every single one of these factors should have its own page and and associated funnel essentially.
0:12:6.231 --> 0:12:11.311
Luis Escobar
You have a ton of reviews that we gotta really just capitalize on more and better in better ways.
0:12:14.201 --> 0:12:16.481
Luis Escobar
So this is one of the ideas that I have.
0:12:16.481 --> 0:12:27.321
Luis Escobar
This is more like a wireframe idea, but the the goal here is to achieve something that that that's like luxurious right? That's a premium.
0:12:27.881 --> 0:12:29.1
Basement
Designer brand.
0:12:29.151 --> 0:12:30.671
Luis Escobar
So designer brand correct.
0:12:30.831 --> 0:12:30.951
Basement
Yep.
0:12:33.451 --> 0:12:37.731
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we're gonna have separate landing pages. Of course, for like man.
0:12:39.271 --> 0:12:42.71
Luis Escobar
Feminine power and you know different ways to resonate with them.
0:12:43.791 --> 0:12:45.431
Luis Escobar
Right now what I want to just.
0:12:47.351 --> 0:12:50.71
Luis Escobar
Those up by Friday is kind of like a border plate, right?
0:12:50.71 --> 0:12:55.431
Luis Escobar
That I think it it should be very similar to what my life force is doing.
0:12:55.871 --> 0:12:56.511
Luis Escobar
I mean what?
0:12:57.231 --> 0:13:0.31
Luis Escobar
What is your guys take on this website overall?
0:13:5.101 --> 0:13:9.741
Basement
The space like I hate things. I hate things that are cluttered.
0:13:6.681 --> 0:13:6.881
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:13:9.981 --> 0:13:15.261
Basement
I love the way I love the design of it. The space? Yeah.
0:13:10.401 --> 0:13:10.601
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:13:14.831 --> 0:13:15.31
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:13:17.571 --> 0:13:17.771
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:13:22.61 --> 0:13:28.301
Basement
It's very evident that they focused not only on on, you know.
0:13:30.271 --> 0:13:30.591
Basement
Living.
0:13:33.271 --> 0:13:41.831
Basement
Longer, but they show you how to live better while you live longer. And I think that's part of our value as well, so.
0:13:43.921 --> 0:13:47.601
Luis Escobar
Yeah, and. And you know this, this app, they're already like, you know.
0:13:49.71 --> 0:13:50.991
Luis Escobar
Prepping you for this idea that you're gonna have it in hand.
0:13:54.351 --> 0:13:55.751
Luis Escobar
Right. And this breakdown right here.
0:13:55.231 --> 0:13:56.551
Basement
Oh, my God. That's what we did.
0:13:58.71 --> 0:13:58.911
Basement
That is legit what we did.
0:13:59.641 --> 0:13:59.881
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:14:1.971 --> 0:14:2.371
Luis Escobar
Great.
0:14:4.351 --> 0:14:6.631
Luis Escobar
Do you guys have some good stuff on your site too?
0:14:6.751 --> 0:14:13.671
Luis Escobar
You know, we're gonna use a lot of it. Just needs to be presented in a better format, better fonts, better styling.
0:14:18.571 --> 0:14:33.771
Luis Escobar
The imagery these these videos, they they make a big impact on the bringing the website to life. I believe we have a a Shutterstock account if I can have access to that too, I'm gonna start creating a folder of kinds of assets.
0:14:33.771 --> 0:14:34.651
Luis Escobar
I think we should start.
0:14:36.111 --> 0:14:36.671
Luis Escobar
Using.
0:14:36.421 --> 0:14:41.181
Basement
Purposely do they purposely on the main site?
0:14:42.911 --> 0:14:44.191
Basement
Remain gender.
0:14:45.781 --> 0:14:51.781
Basement
Agnostic. Basically, they're showing men and women both. I mean because.
0:14:50.41 --> 0:14:50.241
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:14:53.471 --> 0:14:56.751
Basement
The promise that they offer really does change, right?
0:14:56.751 --> 0:14:59.991
Basement
We're we're adding life to your years, you know.
0:15:2.111 --> 0:15:3.631
Basement
So so I like that.
0:15:5.471 --> 0:15:6.511
Basement
For for us.
0:15:8.501 --> 0:15:10.501
Basement
It's not as easy, right?
0:15:10.501 --> 0:15:19.741
Basement
Because we have aesthetics we, you know, we, we we have a different language that we speak. When when we're talking about aesthetics.
0:15:21.261 --> 0:15:22.381
Basement
Possibly right.
0:15:22.741 --> 0:15:28.901
Basement
Aesthetics for some men could be off putting when, when, when what they want is muscle mass.
0:15:29.141 --> 0:15:31.981
Basement
They want energy, sex, drive, whatever.
0:15:31.981 --> 0:15:44.821
Basement
And you see, you know, and you see 25 five year olds getting faith facials, you know? So, so that dichotomy, I think makes sense for us.
0:15:37.201 --> 0:15:37.721
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:15:40.381 --> 0:15:40.901
Luis Escobar
So.
0:15:45.101 --> 0:15:46.901
Basement
But they don't have to deal with that.
0:15:45.261 --> 0:15:45.461
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:15:46.901 --> 0:15:47.461
Basement
You know, I mean.
0:15:48.231 --> 0:15:52.311
Basement
Like I think part of their part of the beauty of their site and their company.
0:15:53.461 --> 0:15:56.461
Basement
Is the ability to hone in on and.
0:15:57.21 --> 0:15:57.221
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:15:58.431 --> 0:16:3.511
Basement
Focus on they don't have to worry about the gender necessarily, you know.
0:16:7.1 --> 0:16:8.881
Luis Escobar
So on the home page, right?
0:16:12.761 --> 0:16:19.681
Luis Escobar
I just typed in this into the browser, right my life force.com so it just took me to the home page. Which. Yeah, you're right, it is.
0:16:20.361 --> 0:16:22.601
Luis Escobar
You know it's neutral, right?
0:16:22.601 --> 0:16:24.561
Luis Escobar
It's inviting for for everyone, right?
0:16:24.921 --> 0:16:29.81
Luis Escobar
Then I I went to Google and I typed in live my life force for men.
0:16:29.441 --> 0:16:31.961
Luis Escobar
I clicked on the first ad and it brought me here.
0:16:32.561 --> 0:16:34.41
Luis Escobar
Add life to your ears.
0:16:34.521 --> 0:16:36.961
Luis Escobar
Here's like a, you know, older, gentle.
0:16:37.991 --> 0:16:38.751
Luis Escobar
Man surfing.
0:16:39.311 --> 0:16:40.191
Luis Escobar
That's amazing.
0:16:41.121 --> 0:16:44.321
Luis Escobar
Right. That's one way to add live tiriards.
0:16:46.131 --> 0:16:48.51
Basement
As long as you don't get eat by shark.
0:16:46.411 --> 0:16:46.891
Luis Escobar
I don't really.
0:16:47.811 --> 0:16:50.451
Luis Escobar
I don't even know what you're selling, but I want it.
0:16:50.671 --> 0:16:51.71
Basement
Yeah.
0:16:52.321 --> 0:16:55.41
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I want to go surfing too.
0:17:0.411 --> 0:17:1.331
Basement
Need a video?
0:17:0.531 --> 0:17:4.451
Luis Escobar
Right, the product matters, of course the product matters, right?
0:17:3.351 --> 0:17:3.551
Basement
Steve.
0:17:4.851 --> 0:17:7.891
Luis Escobar
But it's, you know, these everyone's visual right.
0:17:8.491 --> 0:17:9.851
Luis Escobar
We're all making snap decisions.
0:17:11.271 --> 0:17:11.911
Luis Escobar
Based on what we're seeing.
0:17:14.191 --> 0:17:15.751
Luis Escobar
Now you got my attention.
0:17:15.751 --> 0:17:16.911
Luis Escobar
And now I'm gonna read this.
0:17:17.311 --> 0:17:18.791
Luis Escobar
You know fine print here.
0:17:25.661 --> 0:17:33.621
Luis Escobar
These are publications on 3rd party websites that also is important.
0:17:34.181 --> 0:17:35.541
Luis Escobar
Do we have some of that already?
0:17:36.981 --> 0:17:38.341
Basement
I mean, we did.
0:17:36.991 --> 0:17:37.871
Luis Escobar
Like news outlets.
0:17:38.581 --> 0:17:45.541
Basement
We we did with the previous brand for for sure. I mean you know.
0:17:48.231 --> 0:17:48.351
Basement
CNN.
0:17:48.391 --> 0:17:53.31
Basement
ESPNNBC you know that.
0:17:53.31 --> 0:17:53.951
Basement
That kind of thing.
0:17:54.791 --> 0:17:55.231
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:17:56.31 --> 0:18:10.151
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'll connect those with some like PR guys that I know that that can help us and also some like online services that some new AI services that are doing all the mitigating for you, all the brokering for you.
0:18:10.151 --> 0:18:14.871
Luis Escobar
It's a bunch of middle men, just like trying to like, you know, upsell these publications.
0:18:15.991 --> 0:18:17.231
Luis Escobar
You just need to get to the source.
0:18:23.251 --> 0:18:24.491
Luis Escobar
Across that bridge, when you get there.
0:18:24.491 --> 0:18:26.371
Luis Escobar
But yeah, and then I.
0:18:26.181 --> 0:18:29.21
Basement
What you could put in there though are.
0:18:30.671 --> 0:18:42.791
Basement
The memberships that we do have, which is with the the medical Board or the endocrin society, the American Anti aging, you know what I mean.
0:18:40.531 --> 0:18:40.731
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:18:42.831 --> 0:18:44.391
Basement
Other trust marks?
0:18:44.391 --> 0:18:45.311
Basement
You know, so.
0:18:45.741 --> 0:18:45.941
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:18:49.921 --> 0:18:50.321
Luis Escobar
Oh.
0:18:51.621 --> 0:19:4.301
Luis Escobar
You know, we can definitely build upon that for sure. And and to to the point you were making earlier, right, that you know, how do we stand out when we do so much more than life force actually, right?
0:19:5.831 --> 0:19:10.871
Luis Escobar
You know how? How can we condense everything that we do into, like different categories, right?
0:19:12.551 --> 0:19:18.231
Luis Escobar
Insomnia and fatigue reduce libido and brain fog, irritability and sadness.
0:19:19.911 --> 0:19:21.751
Luis Escobar
And I'm sure they offer a lot more than this.
0:19:22.821 --> 0:19:28.541
Luis Escobar
Right. The symptoms we treat, but there has to be a reason why they chose these five, right?
0:19:28.81 --> 0:19:31.961
Basement
Yeah, I mean, those are the five, those are probably.
0:19:33.471 --> 0:19:49.711
Basement
The only thing that isn't on there, but would probably be related to fatigue would be you know, I want to wake up and feel like I've got energy, you know? But but but but weight gain energy.
0:19:46.421 --> 0:19:46.621
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:19:51.511 --> 0:19:52.431
Basement
Are the two biggest.
0:19:54.391 --> 0:19:55.431
Basement
For girls, for sure.
0:19:57.71 --> 0:19:57.231
Basement
Women.
0:19:58.61 --> 0:19:58.261
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:19:59.221 --> 0:19:59.741
Basement
So.
0:20:1.321 --> 0:20:1.561
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:20:5.461 --> 0:20:9.581
Luis Escobar
So yeah, I mean right, right now the website has a lot of content.
0:20:12.451 --> 0:20:16.91
Luis Escobar
However, I think we got to get more content created, right?
0:20:16.241 --> 0:20:19.601
Luis Escobar
But I like to, I guess, establish that content creation project.
0:20:21.91 --> 0:20:21.371
Luis Escobar
And and.
0:20:22.641 --> 0:20:24.281
Luis Escobar
And the project manager.
0:20:25.771 --> 0:20:31.171
Luis Escobar
So we can just start tackling which are the high priority landing pages that we want published ASAP.
0:20:43.91 --> 0:20:45.131
Luis Escobar
And then the the lead magnets, right?
0:20:45.131 --> 0:20:47.11
Luis Escobar
What? What are the the lead magnets that?
0:20:48.491 --> 0:20:49.131
Luis Escobar
That we're gonna start promoting.
0:20:50.811 --> 0:20:52.531
Luis Escobar
I understand you had like a Wellness.
0:20:54.371 --> 0:20:56.971
Luis Escobar
Wellness blueprint assessment, right?
0:21:0.411 --> 0:21:3.371
Luis Escobar
Here we we have like one that was replicated by the AI.
0:21:3.371 --> 0:21:6.131
Luis Escobar
That's kind of asking the same questions.
0:21:9.331 --> 0:21:10.891
Luis Escobar
Primary Wellness school elevate.
0:21:10.891 --> 0:21:14.171
Luis Escobar
Energy and vitality optimize sleep and recovery.
0:21:15.91 --> 0:21:18.291
Luis Escobar
Enhance mental clarity and focus on its hormones.
0:21:18.291 --> 0:21:21.51
Luis Escobar
Naturally achieve ideal body composition.
0:21:21.91 --> 0:21:23.451
Luis Escobar
Revitalize intimate Wellness.
0:21:24.11 --> 0:21:26.131
Luis Escobar
Embrace longevity and anti aging.
0:21:26.331 --> 0:21:28.11
Luis Escobar
Maximize athletic performance.
0:21:28.571 --> 0:21:35.891
Luis Escobar
Maybe we should let them multi select like multiple or maybe just one, but based on that selection, right, we're gonna put them in a bucket.
0:21:36.611 --> 0:21:40.371
Luis Escobar
And work in the cater the marketing you know to those needs.
0:21:40.801 --> 0:21:42.641
Luis Escobar
It's right. You wanna speak to their pains?
0:21:44.831 --> 0:21:45.151
Luis Escobar
Oh yeah.
0:21:47.281 --> 0:21:53.121
Luis Escobar
If if there I need you to levels are low or if your sleep quality is average right.
0:21:53.121 --> 0:21:58.761
Luis Escobar
Well, all these factors will come into play into you know how we market to these individuals.
0:22:0.71 --> 0:22:1.991
Luis Escobar
You don't want to bombard them with questions, right?
0:22:1.991 --> 0:22:5.551
Luis Escobar
It's kind of like, not really a fan of these super long questionnaires.
0:22:6.971 --> 0:22:8.451
Luis Escobar
At first, we were gonna keep it simple.
0:22:8.451 --> 0:22:11.51
Luis Escobar
We're just gonna ask for your name, e-mail and phone number.
0:22:11.51 --> 0:22:14.11
Luis Escobar
I already know why you're here. 'cause you clicked on this ad.
0:22:15.601 --> 0:22:16.1
Luis Escobar
But.
0:22:16.561 --> 0:22:22.241
Luis Escobar
A little bit further down the journey, once we have a little more trust with them, we can start asking all these questions.
0:22:23.871 --> 0:22:24.191
Luis Escobar
No. Well.
0:22:25.921 --> 0:22:33.841
Luis Escobar
Getting conversions, you know, at a steady you know, you know, high percentage it it does.
0:22:33.841 --> 0:22:39.601
Luis Escobar
It'll trickle down if we have a high conversion rate at the lead source and the lead qualification then.
0:22:41.211 --> 0:22:43.91
Luis Escobar
And encourage a high conversion at the sales point.
0:22:57.911 --> 0:23:4.271
Luis Escobar
In regards to the the current state of like HubSpot, it's, it's actually pretty healthy, right?
0:23:4.431 --> 0:23:7.851
Luis Escobar
I I was asking earlier if are all the calls being recorded.
0:23:10.721 --> 0:23:15.321
Luis Escobar
All those sales calls are the customer support calls, yeah.
0:23:12.931 --> 0:23:13.891
Ximena Livia
I think so.
0:23:19.441 --> 0:23:23.441
Basement
I remember hearing that they were, but to be honest with you, I'm not positive. Brian, do you know?
0:23:24.351 --> 0:23:25.751
Brian Hyatt
Yeah. Yeah, they are.
0:23:25.751 --> 0:23:28.471
Brian Hyatt
And there's transcriptions as well.
0:24:9.921 --> 0:24:14.81
Luis Escobar
Yeah, you do have transcripts and calls, OK.
0:24:17.571 --> 0:24:17.691
Luis Escobar
Umm.
0:24:19.461 --> 0:24:21.941
Luis Escobar
So yeah, I'm gonna extract a lot of that too, right?
0:24:21.941 --> 0:24:23.981
Luis Escobar
And then start putting together.
0:24:25.411 --> 0:24:30.451
Luis Escobar
Some more resources that that's gonna help the AI agents the the live chat agents.
0:24:32.371 --> 0:24:34.291
Luis Escobar
I noticed you guys don't have one on your website, do you?
0:24:36.151 --> 0:24:38.271
Brian Hyatt
No, we did have one.
0:24:38.781 --> 0:24:38.981
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:24:39.31 --> 0:24:39.751
Brian Hyatt
That was.
0:24:39.751 --> 0:24:41.551
Brian Hyatt
I don't know when it was installed, but.
0:24:42.31 --> 0:24:42.231
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:24:43.51 --> 0:24:43.411
Brian Hyatt
It was.
0:24:43.531 --> 0:24:44.571
Brian Hyatt
It was kind of rough.
0:24:45.601 --> 0:24:46.1
Luis Escobar
Who is rob?
0:24:46.211 --> 0:24:51.891
Brian Hyatt
Didn't look good and the results that we were getting from it was they were pretty bad.
0:24:51.521 --> 0:24:51.961
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:24:53.741 --> 0:24:54.501
Luis Escobar
No, I hear you.
0:24:54.541 --> 0:24:58.221
Luis Escobar
Not the the the new ones are are actually rather good.
0:24:58.221 --> 0:25:1.421
Luis Escobar
The one I'm gonna recommend we use is called intercom.
0:25:4.1 --> 0:25:4.121
Luis Escobar
Umm.
0:25:6.461 --> 0:25:10.421
Luis Escobar
It used to be actually pretty pricey, but they really changed it.
0:25:10.701 --> 0:25:13.861
Luis Escobar
Now no ticket subscription.
0:25:15.491 --> 0:25:22.931
Luis Escobar
We just need 1C right now and then we need the AI agent to start this building more and more.
0:25:24.571 --> 0:25:34.411
Luis Escobar
Backlog and and knowledge base and so that's that brings me to my next point which is the knowledge base that that Google sorry that Dropbox you shared with me yesterday that was great.
0:25:36.131 --> 0:25:43.411
Luis Escobar
That's the kind of like insight that that we need to feed into the AI because it's gonna be able to then really come up with the best answers for us.
0:25:46.831 --> 0:25:53.831
Luis Escobar
The more data you can provide and the more recordings all these meetings that we're having, everything should be fed into the AI, right?
0:25:53.871 --> 0:25:58.431
Luis Escobar
And then at the at the end of this meeting, for example, we should, you know, have.
0:26:0.11 --> 0:26:2.651
Luis Escobar
Aii know teams has its own, you know, AI.
0:26:0.851 --> 0:26:1.171
Brian Hyatt
Open.
0:26:2.651 --> 0:26:7.931
Luis Escobar
But we can have something a little more sophisticated that goes and it it talks to the hotspot, right?
0:26:7.931 --> 0:26:11.371
Luis Escobar
And it finds out. Hey, here are some stats from HubSpot.
0:26:11.731 --> 0:26:13.571
Luis Escobar
Here are some stats from Intercom.
0:26:14.241 --> 0:26:20.121
Luis Escobar
Here are some stats from how your team is, you know, doing on texting platform.
0:26:20.681 --> 0:26:23.801
Luis Escobar
It combines all that into the the transcript of this meeting where.
0:26:26.601 --> 0:26:28.241
Luis Escobar
It's a little more contextual.
0:26:35.491 --> 0:26:36.571
Luis Escobar
But right now.
0:26:38.411 --> 0:26:38.731
Luis Escobar
How do?
0:26:38.731 --> 0:26:43.51
Luis Escobar
How do you feel about moving forward with theenewlive.com approach?
0:26:46.281 --> 0:26:51.641
Basement
I'm not opposed to itsoundslikethe.com's the way to go is was was there a certain price on that?
0:26:52.701 --> 0:26:53.621
Luis Escobar
It's 10 bucks.
0:26:54.11 --> 0:26:54.171
Basement
Bstf.
0:26:56.651 --> 0:26:57.611
Basement
10 bugs I don't know.
0:26:57.611 --> 0:26:58.211
Basement
I don't know.
0:27:2.61 --> 0:27:2.501
Basement
Yeah.
0:27:5.961 --> 0:27:10.41
Luis Escobar
Yeah, but here's some other ideas with like a more dark background, right?
0:27:10.801 --> 0:27:17.481
Luis Escobar
Something that we can have to put to the test dark background websites actually can perform well.
0:27:21.861 --> 0:27:24.941
Basement
I can't stand that thought, but other than that.
0:27:26.491 --> 0:27:27.131
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:27:28.871 --> 0:27:32.271
Basement
Did you go through all the mothers? I like the light one better.
0:27:32.711 --> 0:27:34.871
Basement
Yeah, there's I like these.
0:27:33.351 --> 0:27:33.751
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:27:35.831 --> 0:27:36.951
Basement
No, I did.
0:27:36.951 --> 0:27:37.591
Basement
You send these.
0:27:37.751 --> 0:27:39.271
Basement
Yeah, I didn't see them.
0:27:39.351 --> 0:27:42.871
Basement
It's on the teams. Yeah, you need to download teams app.
0:27:42.251 --> 0:27:42.411
Brian Hyatt
OK.
0:27:43.71 --> 0:27:43.911
Basement
No, it's on.
0:27:44.151 --> 0:27:46.991
Basement
It's on my my phone and oh, thanks.
0:27:48.771 --> 0:27:51.91
Basement
The daughter you were on team for like you're right.
0:27:51.91 --> 0:27:54.451
Basement
So it's like every other day.
0:27:56.771 --> 0:27:56.971
Basement
Oh God.
0:27:58.721 --> 0:28:3.961
Luis Escobar
We also really need to consider the the mobile design right so.
0:28:3.521 --> 0:28:4.761
Basement
Yes, yes.
0:28:5.81 --> 0:28:8.681
Luis Escobar
No, this right now is not mobile optimized. For example, right?
0:28:8.681 --> 0:28:9.641
Luis Escobar
This is just a rough.
0:28:11.171 --> 0:28:15.691
Luis Escobar
Draft that I had in AI do so you know, 70% of our traffic will be mobile.
0:28:16.761 --> 0:28:17.361
Luis Escobar
So.
0:28:18.141 --> 0:28:24.741
Basement
I will tell you the most visited site or page of our own site of our old site.
0:28:26.291 --> 0:28:28.211
Basement
Was people wanted to know what the.
0:28:31.211 --> 0:28:38.51
Basement
Process was so they they wanted to be able to see, you know what? What, what? Where do I start?
0:28:38.91 --> 0:28:39.251
Basement
What's the next step?
0:28:39.291 --> 0:28:40.91
Basement
Yada yada yada.
0:28:40.91 --> 0:28:46.811
Basement
So I know that that's a question that most folks have and quite frankly.
0:28:48.161 --> 0:28:50.441
Basement
Life Force does a pretty good job of it.
0:28:52.891 --> 0:29:0.491
Basement
Although it's almost too simplistic, really. I mean it doesn't tell you who's.
0:29:0.731 --> 0:29:2.931
Basement
You know what? Once you sign up.
0:29:4.651 --> 0:29:8.411
Basement
I don't know what it what it does, but I kind of want to know.
0:29:10.71 --> 0:29:12.671
Luis Escobar
I don't know what it does, but I know I'm gonna be surfing soon.
0:29:14.361 --> 0:29:16.721
Basement
Right, right, right.
0:29:16.141 --> 0:29:19.21
Luis Escobar
You know, that's what we gotta write.
0:29:18.171 --> 0:29:25.771
Basement
I also really like on their you just scrolled past it a second ago, but they have.
0:29:27.451 --> 0:29:28.571
Basement
Some symbol. I don't know what it is.
0:29:28.571 --> 0:29:35.771
Basement
It's like colors, but they put that next to the like life score. Yeah, and I don't.
0:29:35.791 --> 0:29:36.391
Luis Escobar
Listing.
0:29:35.811 --> 0:29:38.11
Basement
I mean, I know we have our story and things like that.
0:29:38.11 --> 0:29:42.731
Basement
Yeah, that. But they also put that on like their graphics on social.
0:29:43.81 --> 0:29:57.651
Basement
And like if they do a testimonial, they'll kind of put not all of them, but in some of them they'll put that symbol with the score next to it. I feel like that's a really good way, like to show someone's progress compared to them just saying like.
0:29:57.681 --> 0:29:58.681
Basement
Oh, I feel.
0:29:58.761 --> 0:30:8.281
Basement
I feel better, you know? So I think that would be a good something that we could explore and see what we can do, like make it our own, obviously.
0:30:9.211 --> 0:30:12.771
Basement
But to me, that's a really appealing like instead of just.
0:30:13.281 --> 0:30:18.841
Basement
Looking at all of my labs, I kind of just look at this one number, but I feel like they really highlight that.
0:30:18.881 --> 0:30:25.961
Basement
So and we, Justin, we we have something that's like version 1.0 of that. Yeah, right in the.
0:30:26.751 --> 0:30:29.431
Basement
Re review story, have you seen it?
0:30:29.821 --> 0:30:33.901
Basement
You know, so yeah. But but you're exactly right.
0:30:33.941 --> 0:30:42.621
Basement
I mean, I don't know what the algorithm is that they use to predict the scoring or what your.
0:30:45.111 --> 0:30:51.391
Basement
Logical age is relative to your chronological age, you know.
0:30:51.791 --> 0:30:54.591
Basement
But I think that's kind of neat too, right?
0:30:54.671 --> 0:30:57.511
Basement
You know, if I'm 55.
0:30:59.71 --> 0:30:59.191
Basement
But.
0:30:59.871 --> 0:31:6.711
Basement
You know the the longer I'm a member with them, the more optimal I am I can get down to 38.
0:31:6.911 --> 0:31:8.791
Basement
Yeah, kind of thing so.
0:31:10.141 --> 0:31:11.741
Luis Escobar
I think that's huge, yeah.
0:31:10.311 --> 0:31:11.791
Basement
I think that's a really good touch.
0:31:13.241 --> 0:31:15.881
Luis Escobar
And I don't think it should be that difficult to achieve either.
0:31:15.881 --> 0:31:20.801
Luis Escobar
No. We create the 10 point you know calculation, right.
0:31:22.481 --> 0:31:24.81
Luis Escobar
Assign these different variables to it and then.
0:31:25.681 --> 0:31:26.641
Luis Escobar
It it figures it out by itself, right?
0:31:28.241 --> 0:31:29.921
Luis Escobar
And the idea is to keep it simple, right?
0:31:29.921 --> 0:31:34.801
Luis Escobar
Nobody likes reading these lengthy they can if they want, they can always, you know, dive into it.
0:31:34.961 --> 0:31:39.441
Luis Escobar
But at a glance they wanna see a sample easy to digest.
0:31:41.271 --> 0:31:46.71
Luis Escobar
Report or or or number I. I think that's a great initiative.
0:31:44.221 --> 0:31:45.141
Basement
Well, and what what?
0:31:45.141 --> 0:31:46.101
Basement
You really want them?
0:31:46.501 --> 0:31:47.301
Basement
What? What, what?
0:31:47.301 --> 0:31:53.341
Basement
What you really want too is for them to always be looking to improve, right? So so you always gotta.
0:31:52.571 --> 0:31:52.771
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:31:53.541 --> 0:32:3.901
Basement
You always, always have to have that carrot out there saying you need us kind of thing, you know, you know, we're better off together, you know.
0:31:59.741 --> 0:31:59.941
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:32:4.421 --> 0:32:4.621
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:32:5.391 --> 0:32:12.391
Basement
It also serves as like a when you look at testimonials and see someone with like a high life score, whatever they call it.
0:32:13.111 --> 0:32:13.951
Basement
I feel like that.
0:32:14.981 --> 0:32:24.141
Basement
Creates kind of like a competitive isn't the right word, but like if someone with a really low score was looking at it instead of being like, oh, that Lady says that she feels this and this.
0:32:24.141 --> 0:32:26.821
Basement
It's like, oh, her life scores this much higher than mine.
0:32:26.821 --> 0:32:29.341
Basement
It gives you something to like strive for.
0:32:30.61 --> 0:32:31.61
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:32:30.831 --> 0:32:33.551
Basement
And like a just a straightforward like this is where they're at.
0:32:33.551 --> 0:32:38.431
Basement
This is where I want to be type of thing, but I know that's a future thing.
0:32:38.431 --> 0:32:38.871
Basement
Do you?
0:32:38.451 --> 0:32:39.11
Luis Escobar
Do you?
0:32:38.871 --> 0:32:42.271
Basement
Do you have any problem with anewlife.com on the aesthetic side?
0:32:39.11 --> 0:32:40.11
Luis Escobar
Do you have?
0:32:41.761 --> 0:32:41.801
Luis Escobar
A.
0:32:44.911 --> 0:32:46.111
Basement
Does that overcome?
0:32:46.421 --> 0:32:53.101
Basement
Or I don't think it does, but I'm asking you 'cause. I know you have a better sense on that.
0:32:54.871 --> 0:33:11.31
Basement
I mean the only thing I think that for either side, it doesn't really matter that much, but I'm just wondering like whenever I go to search life force, I always get a little tripped up because I just type in life force and that it like doesn't come up.
0:33:11.391 --> 0:33:13.991
Basement
First, because I'm I'm not putting my in front of it.
0:33:14.671 --> 0:33:17.431
Basement
It might come up like in there somewhere like the first thing.
0:33:17.781 --> 0:33:20.701
Basement
But do you think like that's a problem?
0:33:20.741 --> 0:33:23.61
Basement
What happens if you type in lifeforce.com?
0:33:23.541 --> 0:33:24.341
Basement
Does anything?
0:33:24.341 --> 0:33:26.21
Basement
Does it come up on Google or like?
0:33:27.471 --> 0:33:28.671
Basement
AI also know a lot of like.
0:33:28.901 --> 0:33:31.781
Luis Escobar
2nd through oh, they own that one too. Good for them.
0:33:31.311 --> 0:33:31.911
Basement
Yeah. Oh, OK.
0:33:33.551 --> 0:33:35.151
Basement
I think they used to.
0:33:35.551 --> 0:33:36.151
Basement
I don't know.
0:33:36.191 --> 0:33:47.231
Basement
Anyways, I was just wondering if that would get confusing, but then I also know a lot of even like retail brands do that and you kind of just type type it in until you find it.
0:33:47.581 --> 0:33:48.941
Basement
So we own.
0:33:48.521 --> 0:33:48.881
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:33:52.31 --> 0:33:53.191
Basement
Anew.com.
0:33:54.991 --> 0:33:58.431
Basement
Now that that's better, I'm just saying I think we own.
0:33:59.751 --> 0:33:59.951
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:34:0.111 --> 0:34:0.431
Brian Hyatt
Thank you.
0:34:0.191 --> 0:34:0.551
Basement
Quite a few.
0:34:2.391 --> 0:34:16.671
Basement
Variations. I don't if it's pointed toward a new deco yet, but I think as long as when you type in like Google search Anu that it comes up first and it doesn't make a difference really what the domain is in my opinion.
0:34:12.471 --> 0:34:12.671
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:34:14.341 --> 0:34:14.861
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:34:17.591 --> 0:34:18.551
Luis Escobar
No, for sure.
0:34:18.591 --> 0:34:21.711
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we'll we'll make sure that's well structured.
0:34:22.231 --> 0:34:29.951
Luis Escobar
Also on that note, I I would like to also just get access to all the Google brand accounts so that I can adjust them.
0:34:30.31 --> 0:34:35.871
Luis Escobar
We should have a, you know, a Google business listing here with reviews.
0:34:36.631 --> 0:34:40.231
Luis Escobar
You know, we we should have one for each location also.
0:34:40.941 --> 0:34:41.501
Basement
Don't we?
0:34:41.541 --> 0:34:42.261
Basement
We do.
0:34:42.751 --> 0:34:43.631
Luis Escobar
We do OK.
0:34:43.791 --> 0:34:45.31
Basement
Yeah, if you.
0:34:48.111 --> 0:34:50.671
Basement
Yeah. Yeah. When I if you type in just a new.
0:34:50.671 --> 0:34:53.391
Basement
I don't know why it's not, but he's in Miami, so.
0:34:53.391 --> 0:34:57.311
Basement
Oh, right. Yeah. OK. That makes more sense.
0:34:54.381 --> 0:34:55.61
Luis Escobar
Maybe that's why.
0:34:56.841 --> 0:34:58.401
Luis Escobar
You know new Lexington.
0:34:58.841 --> 0:34:59.681
Luis Escobar
Nah, it shows up.
0:34:59.111 --> 0:35:0.831
Basement
Yeah, we have one for all of them.
0:35:1.111 --> 0:35:3.351
Basement
You picked out one more worse one.
0:35:1.461 --> 0:35:2.701
Luis Escobar
For each location.
0:35:3.391 --> 0:35:6.951
Basement
Yeah, he picked out literally the worst one.
0:35:6.951 --> 0:35:9.271
Basement
Springhurst yeah, a new springhurst.
0:35:15.221 --> 0:35:20.221
Luis Escobar
Do you guys have a lot of families as clients like a husband and wife or?
0:35:21.721 --> 0:35:23.241
Luis Escobar
Family members all becoming clients.
0:35:26.661 --> 0:35:29.301
Basement
Definitely husband wife.
0:35:29.771 --> 0:35:30.811
Luis Escobar
Definitely help me and wife.
0:35:30.791 --> 0:35:40.631
Basement
But I like the family idea. I mean, if you have adult kids, I mean you, you know, look, what are the biggest things that we have to offer?
0:35:42.191 --> 0:35:43.551
Basement
Is medical access right?
0:35:43.551 --> 0:35:49.871
Basement
I mean, if you're sick, you're traveling for work, you're on vacation.
0:35:46.161 --> 0:35:46.361
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:35:49.991 --> 0:35:52.431
Basement
I mean, we are your concier doc.
0:35:52.431 --> 0:35:55.871
Basement
I mean we we we take take over so literally.
0:35:52.601 --> 0:35:53.161
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:35:56.821 --> 0:36:0.581
Basement
The app need you know if we get to that point.
0:35:57.61 --> 0:35:57.541
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:36:1.181 --> 0:36:6.261
Basement
I mean, you know the version 1.0 just needs to be accessibility, right?
0:36:6.261 --> 0:36:9.61
Basement
I mean, I can book online, I can.
0:36:9.381 --> 0:36:14.621
Basement
I can say I'm sick online and and start a synchronous type.
0:36:11.831 --> 0:36:12.31
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:36:15.861 --> 0:36:18.141
Basement
Health to visit that kind of thing.
0:36:18.711 --> 0:36:18.911
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:36:19.791 --> 0:36:19.951
Basement
Yeah.
0:36:22.51 --> 0:36:22.931
Luis Escobar
Gotcha. Gotcha.
0:36:23.91 --> 0:36:23.731
Luis Escobar
Yeah, definitely.
0:36:23.731 --> 0:36:24.971
Luis Escobar
We're gonna achieve that.
0:36:23.741 --> 0:36:27.541
Basement
I forgot to say to Yelp, Yelp, Steve Flores, and Yelp.
0:36:25.371 --> 0:36:26.531
Luis Escobar
See, I think you know.
0:36:28.81 --> 0:36:37.481
Luis Escobar
What I'm envisioning is like, you know, the the long term goals that like you, if you're a member of any location or you're a member of a new life, right.
0:36:37.481 --> 0:36:45.561
Luis Escobar
Obviously you you log in and you have your preferred location right? With content that is like relevant to that location, right?
0:36:47.241 --> 0:36:54.161
Luis Escobar
However, you know, as we expand and we start to get more and more, you know, regional and national, you know customers right.
0:36:55.71 --> 0:36:56.631
Luis Escobar
They'll still get that same.
0:36:58.121 --> 0:37:15.1
Luis Escobar
User experience right in the form of the app and and hopefully that you know it's it's able to convey a, you know a great user experience and it makes perfect sense for husband and the wife to like sign up for husband and wife and older adult children to.
0:37:15.1 --> 0:37:15.321
Luis Escobar
Sign up also.
0:37:15.791 --> 0:37:15.911
Luis Escobar
Umm.
0:37:18.351 --> 0:37:23.431
Luis Escobar
I think you know you bundle the prices or I don't know how you work it out, right.
0:37:21.51 --> 0:37:21.411
Basement
Yeah.
0:37:24.961 --> 0:37:31.241
Luis Escobar
That, and especially on the competitive side, I can see a husband and wife, you know, competing on like who's improving their score faster.
0:37:35.121 --> 0:37:36.441
Luis Escobar
You can make a challenge out of it.
0:37:38.1 --> 0:37:41.401
Luis Escobar
Just out of the creative ideas can come out of that.
0:37:48.941 --> 0:37:55.221
Luis Escobar
In regards to like the telehealth is, do you guys already have some technology that you're using?
0:37:57.831 --> 0:37:59.711
Basement
It's not not good.
0:37:59.751 --> 0:38:1.111
Basement
It needs a revamp for sure.
0:38:1.111 --> 0:38:3.111
Basement
We're using teams for it anyways.
0:38:3.151 --> 0:38:13.431
Basement
It's a lot of manual steps and, but if we have it, it's available we we we really do need to find an integrated EMR.
0:38:15.151 --> 0:38:15.791
Basement
For telehealth.
0:38:17.551 --> 0:38:18.231
Basement
Or you could save.
0:38:19.191 --> 0:38:21.631
Basement
Just take a better EMR overall.
0:38:23.191 --> 0:38:26.951
Basement
That can support telehealth and or brick and mortar and or aesthetics.
0:38:27.381 --> 0:38:28.461
Basement
You know, I mean.
0:38:30.311 --> 0:38:32.471
Basement
That that, that would be ideal.
0:38:34.271 --> 0:38:34.591
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:38:34.591 --> 0:38:41.31
Luis Escobar
I'll do some research, but is there any like, you know, industry leaders like at the HubSpot of EM Rs?
0:38:39.941 --> 0:38:47.661
Basement
Yeah. So so like there there's a EMR called healthy healthy.
0:38:49.71 --> 0:38:55.751
Basement
That is primarily for telehealth, but it does AI scribe it does.
0:38:55.751 --> 0:38:59.711
Basement
I mean, it's apparently extremely fluid.
0:39:1.871 --> 0:39:3.111
Basement
Very good.
0:39:4.421 --> 0:39:5.461
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:39:5.151 --> 0:39:8.951
Basement
EMR for telehealth. So we've also looked at.
0:39:9.341 --> 0:39:14.781
Basement
E Clinical Works mod Med patient now practice Q.
0:39:17.351 --> 0:39:17.911
Basement
Zenote.
0:39:21.391 --> 0:39:31.231
Basement
There was one one of the a lot of the a lot of the biggest draw draw drawbacks are the fact that they're not open source.
0:39:31.231 --> 0:39:35.991
Basement
Right. I mean, they're they're not really, we we we don't have any that.
0:39:35.991 --> 0:39:38.311
Basement
Yeah, that was API was just.
0:39:38.701 --> 0:39:40.861
Basement
Being able to migrate over all of our data.
0:39:42.391 --> 0:39:50.631
Basement
Into one of these systems and then just be able to extract data, yeah. And then if we were ever to move away again, to be able to get all that back out, I don't know.
0:39:50.631 --> 0:40:1.831
Basement
Yeah, well, but. But also if we designed our own app, it would need to be able to to update and or extract data from it, right?
0:40:1.831 --> 0:40:7.831
Basement
I mean, so, so. So I think some of those.
0:40:8.181 --> 0:40:10.981
Basement
Some of those Emrs were very closed.
0:40:12.431 --> 0:40:15.71
Basement
You know, they, they they didn't have a lot of it.
0:40:15.311 --> 0:40:16.431
Basement
But I connections correct.
0:40:16.871 --> 0:40:23.871
Basement
Yeah, I mean, well, most of them had pretty robust API connections. It was just like.
0:40:25.591 --> 0:40:33.191
Basement
Some of those that did either didn't have, like a lab integration or you prescribing integration built in or.
0:40:34.821 --> 0:40:35.941
Basement
Well, there there was.
0:40:35.941 --> 0:40:38.941
Basement
I don't think there was more.
0:40:38.941 --> 0:40:42.781
Basement
It was more so a concern about getting it all migrated over.
0:40:44.351 --> 0:41:1.511
Basement
We weren't really thinking about an app at that time, so that wasn't really a compound, but, but we were thinking about Pavlo, right, and and being able to because of the custom LabCorp and like the integration we have with LabCorp Open Dell.
0:41:3.541 --> 0:41:9.981
Luis Escobar
No, the fact that you guys have everything you know in your own private database is huge.
0:41:9.981 --> 0:41:13.61
Luis Escobar
Actually it gives a lot of freedom to what we can do.
0:41:13.381 --> 0:41:26.701
Luis Escobar
I think I'm gonna do, you know, some research on this. What these guys are are doing on their end and and how we can either maybe utilize one of the ones you recommended or a new one or try to emulate what they're doing, right, we we don't necess.
0:41:27.141 --> 0:41:29.341
Luis Escobar
We probably don't need all the bells and whistles.
0:41:30.151 --> 0:41:33.351
Luis Escobar
They usually over, you know, fill it with a bunch of features that we don't need.
0:41:35.181 --> 0:41:40.981
Basement
That's the only thing about open dental, too, is it's like $650 a month for all.
0:41:41.21 --> 0:41:42.461
Basement
Or yeah, it's super cheap.
0:41:42.621 --> 0:41:44.101
Basement
Yeah, it's it's very cheap.
0:41:44.851 --> 0:41:45.851
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:41:46.381 --> 0:41:57.701
Basement
Compared to the alternatives and it required and it's like just a. It's just a few database tables, basically pieced together in the back end. Very easy to like.
0:41:57.701 --> 0:42:0.61
Basement
You just set up AI agent loose on it and.
0:42:0.891 --> 0:42:1.451
Luis Escobar
Exactly.
0:42:2.671 --> 0:42:6.911
Basement
So what was I gonna say, chip?
0:42:8.471 --> 0:42:26.191
Basement
Yeah, a lot of the Emrs, the bigger ones, are really meant for for like medical offices that take insurance. So that there's a lot of billing and coding that we don't need.
0:42:26.271 --> 0:42:28.551
Basement
So, so, so you end up paying for.
0:42:29.71 --> 0:42:29.271
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:42:29.271 --> 0:42:29.831
Basement
A lot of that.
0:42:31.631 --> 0:42:31.831
Basement
Technology.
0:42:32.301 --> 0:42:33.701
Basement
That you really never use.
0:42:34.341 --> 0:42:35.181
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
0:42:35.791 --> 0:42:40.231
Basement
And they're built for Staffs that just don't have the technical expertise to build in different plugins and stuff.
0:42:40.231 --> 0:42:42.151
Basement
They just be ready right out-of-the-box.
0:42:42.671 --> 0:42:45.591
Basement
Like but without probably the flexibility.
0:42:44.131 --> 0:42:44.531
Luis Escobar
I got.
0:42:47.441 --> 0:42:47.881
Luis Escobar
Gotcha.
0:42:51.261 --> 0:42:53.671
Luis Escobar
So yeah, I I did receive.
0:42:53.671 --> 0:42:53.681
Luis Escobar
I.
0:42:53.681 --> 0:42:56.421
Luis Escobar
I believe your e-mail in regards to getting access to the database.
0:42:58.111 --> 0:43:2.351
Luis Escobar
I'm gonna engage on that probably tomorrow at the earliest.
0:43:3.991 --> 0:43:18.311
Luis Escobar
Right. Tonight, I'm gonna get that. You know, initial deployment of of the staging website. So that start looking at something that's actually more in line with what you know the the 1.0 version is gonna be.
0:43:19.991 --> 0:43:26.831
Luis Escobar
From what I'm getting, I think we wanna go with that light. You know, design that sophisticated luxury approach.
0:43:30.591 --> 0:43:38.951
Luis Escobar
We want to, you know, use some of the takeaways from life force in, in terms of like the space and the less is more right.
0:43:38.951 --> 0:43:42.791
Luis Escobar
They're not saying too much, but they're saying a lot, especially with the with the imagery.
0:43:44.991 --> 0:43:52.431
Luis Escobar
So yeah, if I can get access to the Shutterstock, I'll start. You know, going in there, picking out a bunch of winners.
0:43:52.711 --> 0:43:58.431
Luis Escobar
I know we wanna, you know, get our own imagery done and shot and we can and we should.
0:43:58.551 --> 0:44:1.751
Luis Escobar
But for sure you know for the initial start, we'll.
0:44:2.861 --> 0:44:4.501
Luis Escobar
Try to stop would be more than sufficient.
0:44:6.331 --> 0:44:13.331
Basement
Do you think that I was chatting with our graphic designer for this? Do you think that Shutterstock is the best?
0:44:16.271 --> 0:44:34.551
Basement
Option we I was looking through life force their Instagram and I like so many things about it. But one of the things when they post like reels I don't know who the woman is. It's the blonde woman in that picture right there. But she'll make like selfie style.
0:44:21.511 --> 0:44:21.711
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:44:34.551 --> 0:44:34.871
Basement
Videos.
0:44:35.181 --> 0:44:46.781
Basement
In the cover photos that they use, they're pretty much all stock from what I can assume, and they look really nice. But do you think that they're getting those from Shutterstock?
0:44:46.821 --> 0:44:54.741
Basement
Because when we use stock photos, they feel very stock photo and they're not really doing what we want them to do.
0:44:55.341 --> 0:44:58.501
Basement
So we're kind of at a point right now.
0:44:55.441 --> 0:44:56.41
Luis Escobar
I hear you.
0:44:58.501 --> 0:44:59.861
Basement
Is there a higher level?
0:45:1.71 --> 0:45:5.111
Basement
Subscription maybe. I think we have the full access to everything.
0:45:5.301 --> 0:45:21.111
Basement
But it's just like the people in the photos that we see are just not what we would want to portray on anything or they just look super staged where like the photos, I see them use look real and maybe they're taking those photos. I would be surprised if.
0:45:20.201 --> 0:45:20.361
Brian Hyatt
OK.
0:45:21.111 --> 0:45:24.101
Basement
They are, but I just didn't know your opinion on that.
0:45:24.781 --> 0:45:33.221
Luis Escobar
There's a few different, you know, really good service providers even like Getty getting images as a subscription.
0:45:33.221 --> 0:45:34.741
Luis Escobar
That's sometimes really good.
0:45:36.791 --> 0:45:40.671
Luis Escobar
There's another one called a stack diary.
0:45:43.231 --> 0:45:48.271
Luis Escobar
I'll send a few links on the ones I think we can get some really high quality content from.
0:45:49.241 --> 0:45:49.561
Basement
OK.
0:45:50.71 --> 0:45:50.911
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:45:50.911 --> 0:45:52.871
Luis Escobar
So it doesn't have to be shorter stock.
0:45:53.811 --> 0:45:54.291
Basement
OK.
0:45:54.451 --> 0:45:59.851
Basement
Yeah, they have a lot of stuff, but I feel like half of their stuff isn't good, so.
0:45:54.761 --> 0:45:54.961
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:46:1.131 --> 0:46:3.931
Luis Escobar
Yeah. So it depends on, I think the niche for sure.
0:46:2.311 --> 0:46:2.471
Basement
Yeah.
0:46:3.931 --> 0:46:5.531
Luis Escobar
Yeah, some of it is cringe.
0:46:5.971 --> 0:46:7.331
Basement
Yeah, absolutely.
0:46:8.191 --> 0:46:8.511
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:46:10.821 --> 0:46:13.301
Luis Escobar
Alright, a film supply.
0:46:13.301 --> 0:46:14.341
Luis Escobar
That's another good one.
0:46:15.911 --> 0:46:19.31
Luis Escobar
It's like high end cinema type like cinematography.
0:46:19.441 --> 0:46:19.921
Basement
Yeah.
0:46:24.431 --> 0:46:26.231
Luis Escobar
I wanted to also ask about.
0:46:27.911 --> 0:46:28.31
Luis Escobar
The.
0:46:32.101 --> 0:46:34.541
Luis Escobar
The socials. Ted. I saw your e-mail.
0:46:35.421 --> 0:46:35.621
Basement
Mm hmm.
0:46:36.231 --> 0:46:37.991
Luis Escobar
Here you sent a few of these are already.
0:46:40.591 --> 0:46:44.351
Luis Escobar
So in your official, in your aesthetics, in your optimal health.
0:46:45.871 --> 0:46:46.191
Luis Escobar
Official in new.
0:46:49.761 --> 0:46:50.921
Luis Escobar
Last legacy account.
0:46:54.431 --> 0:46:55.351
Luis Escobar
The new official.
0:47:0.181 --> 0:47:7.141
Luis Escobar
Is someone actively in charge of, you know, posting every day and engaging with with the audience?
0:47:8.411 --> 0:47:9.51
Basement
Yes.
0:47:10.991 --> 0:47:13.151
Basement
That should not have zero post.
0:47:14.701 --> 0:47:15.981
Basement
We just looked at that yesterday.
0:47:17.471 --> 0:47:18.991
Basement
That's X, yeah.
0:47:19.21 --> 0:47:21.981
Luis Escobar
That's X Instagram.
0:47:22.881 --> 0:47:25.161
Basement
Yeah. We just looked at that yesterday though.
0:47:26.671 --> 0:47:28.351
Basement
Yeah, but did I look at the post?
0:47:28.471 --> 0:47:30.111
Basement
Yeah, we post on it three times a week.
0:47:31.751 --> 0:47:31.871
Luis Escobar
Aye.
0:47:31.791 --> 0:47:36.391
Basement
There should be post on there. I I saw them like yesterday when we were scrolling through.
0:47:36.431 --> 0:47:39.151
Basement
They don't get any engagement, but there's posts on there.
0:47:40.131 --> 0:47:43.131
Luis Escobar
No, it's fine. Yeah, basically, yeah.
0:47:41.891 --> 0:47:44.771
Basement
I just don't know why it's I haven't posted yet, but.
0:47:45.621 --> 0:47:50.741
Luis Escobar
Gotcha. Yeah, we'll you know, we're going to refine the whole social media strategy as well.
0:47:52.551 --> 0:47:57.391
Luis Escobar
I was mentioning to Brian like you know, we want to create like a content creation machine, right?
0:47:57.391 --> 0:48:6.111
Luis Escobar
So like we we we have maybe a week or or a few days out of the month where where we generate or produce a lot of ideas, right.
0:47:57.501 --> 0:47:57.861
Basement
Yeah.
0:48:6.111 --> 0:48:13.591
Luis Escobar
And we we hire the actors or we get the scenes shot internally or or whatever it takes.
0:48:14.201 --> 0:48:20.881
Luis Escobar
And but then we we have, you know, 3-4, six weeks of content that that we can rely on, right.
0:48:21.281 --> 0:48:22.481
Luis Escobar
So we're always like.
0:48:23.991 --> 0:48:25.831
Luis Escobar
We always have an abundance of content to use.
0:48:27.471 --> 0:48:28.871
Luis Escobar
That's like our failure content.
0:48:28.871 --> 0:48:31.711
Luis Escobar
That's how we get the algorithm to to pay attention to us.
0:48:32.71 --> 0:48:43.71
Luis Escobar
Then there's there's the organic stuff that's like more, you know, a little more thoughtful and and and and inline with. Maybe the current events, right?
0:48:43.991 --> 0:48:44.551
Basement
Yeah.
0:48:46.441 --> 0:48:49.111
Luis Escobar
What was that trend the other day? Oh.
0:48:49.661 --> 0:48:51.981
Luis Escobar
There's always these trends on Instagram, right?
0:48:51.981 --> 0:48:57.781
Luis Escobar
So you know, if we see something that's catching on, you know, just Ashton hag with the, with the ice.
0:48:58.551 --> 0:48:59.71
Basement
Thank you.
0:48:59.551 --> 0:49:1.431
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, you know.
0:49:1.421 --> 0:49:5.61
Basement
Yeah, and one that I sent to you, I think.
0:49:6.711 --> 0:49:7.311
Basement
Sprayed it off.
0:49:7.311 --> 0:49:8.511
Basement
Yeah, I like that one.
0:49:8.631 --> 0:49:9.431
Basement
I thought that was cute.
0:49:9.471 --> 0:49:10.791
Basement
I mean, yeah, that was cool.
0:49:11.851 --> 0:49:17.451
Luis Escobar
So, like we, we should always like have the flexibility like to jump on those trends, right.
0:49:17.451 --> 0:49:22.891
Luis Escobar
Because they do build a buzz and we we we get an influx of, you know, new eyeballs or whatever.
0:49:25.461 --> 0:49:35.941
Luis Escobar
So a combination of always having you know constant content, you know ready to go and then always being you know on the lookout for for fresh new ideas that are gonna hopefully go viral.
0:49:37.1 --> 0:49:37.481
Basement
Yeah.
0:49:40.151 --> 0:49:42.351
Luis Escobar
And then these these holidays.
0:49:40.261 --> 0:49:41.941
Basement
Right, right now.
0:49:43.551 --> 0:49:50.151
Basement
Right, right. Right now the social is broken by, you know, health versus aesthetics.
0:49:50.751 --> 0:49:51.511
Basement
I don't mean.
0:49:53.421 --> 0:50:4.941
Basement
I don't necessarily mean against like me, but but that that that's the way we've got it broken out, one of the debates, one of the debates have been, you know, know your audience.
0:49:59.751 --> 0:49:59.951
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:50:4.981 --> 0:50:6.421
Basement
What voice you use?
0:50:6.421 --> 0:50:10.701
Basement
Color emotion, you know, is it better that you break it?
0:50:11.981 --> 0:50:21.181
Basement
Gender. You know, a new woman, a new man. You know that does. Is that better or worse than breaking it by service?
0:50:22.351 --> 0:50:22.871
Basement
So.
0:50:23.851 --> 0:50:24.531
Luis Escobar
We.
0:50:24.141 --> 0:50:25.101
Basement
On a social.
0:50:25.951 --> 0:50:26.991
Luis Escobar
Yeah. I mean, we have to.
0:50:27.511 --> 0:50:36.431
Luis Escobar
It depends on on you know if we have like an abundance of well-rounded content that we can cater to all the niches in in in one channel.
0:50:37.941 --> 0:50:39.461
Luis Escobar
No. If not you know it.
0:50:39.741 --> 0:50:43.141
Luis Escobar
Maybe it makes more sense to build our our foundation.
0:50:43.141 --> 0:50:55.821
Luis Escobar
Get a get a strong community of only men, only females, and you know there is definitely a higher chance that they're gonna follow an account. That's just all all women, right?
0:50:55.821 --> 0:50:57.101
Luis Escobar
Speaking about Women's Health.
0:51:3.871 --> 0:51:15.991
Luis Escobar
I think you know the the, the a new life idea. Me and Brian were saying earlier like I was mentioning to him like it sound it sounds a little like a new life, a new life, a new life, a new life.
0:51:18.591 --> 0:51:22.231
Luis Escobar
We can play with that. I'd you know those those word games.
0:51:23.201 --> 0:51:23.521
Basement
Right.
0:51:38.501 --> 0:51:43.261
Luis Escobar
Also, I just want to touch upon the the the e-commerce side.
0:51:43.261 --> 0:51:45.661
Luis Escobar
I know you have a Shopify website, right?
0:51:46.521 --> 0:51:49.441
Basement
Yeah, neither. We actually have two, I think.
0:51:50.911 --> 0:51:55.311
Basement
And neither are really being used. Much to my knowledge, right?
0:51:58.711 --> 0:52:2.151
Basement
Somebody bought a gift card through there somehow. I don't even know.
0:52:4.181 --> 0:52:4.941
Basement
So no more.
0:52:4.941 --> 0:52:5.901
Basement
I mean, we're not using it.
0:52:6.681 --> 0:52:7.601
Luis Escobar
What's the domain?
0:52:9.561 --> 0:52:11.471
Renzo Mogrovejo
Shop at eny.co.
0:52:12.201 --> 0:52:12.361
Luis Escobar
Stop.
0:52:15.731 --> 0:52:18.331
Luis Escobar
OK. So I mean, what was the idea?
0:52:18.331 --> 0:52:21.571
Luis Escobar
Here are. Is this still the intention to have also?
0:52:23.31 --> 0:52:26.471
Luis Escobar
This e-commerce out of CART shopping experience.
0:52:30.231 --> 0:52:43.231
Renzo Mogrovejo
That was the previous website we migrated almost all services to to indian.com and that was the preview in India that Co site.
0:52:33.841 --> 0:52:34.41
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:52:43.311 --> 0:52:46.231
Renzo Mogrovejo
So we changed the the domain.
0:52:47.41 --> 0:52:47.241
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:52:47.951 --> 0:52:50.311
Renzo Mogrovejo
And we set it like show that in.
0:52:52.641 --> 0:52:52.801
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:52:52.911 --> 0:52:53.911
Renzo Mogrovejo
Just not close down.
0:52:54.951 --> 0:53:4.111
Luis Escobar
But right now, like if I'm a customer that I like, this new bio serum firm like, what's the best way for me to get it again or?
0:53:6.361 --> 0:53:8.721
Luis Escobar
Restock it for myself.
0:53:9.471 --> 0:53:13.871
Basement
Almost all of our products are sold.
0:53:15.351 --> 0:53:19.751
Basement
Brick and mortar, you know, so they're all inventoried at the offices.
0:53:21.471 --> 0:53:25.831
Basement
But but, but that doesn't mean that it has to be like that, I mean.
0:53:27.471 --> 0:53:36.31
Basement
They're all medical grade. So. So you can't just go online and buy, buy, buy these anywhere. They have to be sold by.
0:53:38.671 --> 0:53:39.271
Basement
A medical.
0:53:39.581 --> 0:53:41.741
Basement
Facility, I guess if you will so.
0:53:42.941 --> 0:53:43.501
Luis Escobar
Got it.
0:53:45.111 --> 0:53:56.871
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'm just thinking like, you know, if I log into my members portal and I, you know I can click a button that says I I need a renew my my serum or.
0:53:58.581 --> 0:54:4.501
Luis Escobar
The you know, I I come in to pick it up or or or I set the appointment to get the prescription.
0:54:4.901 --> 0:54:10.781
Luis Escobar
But essentially, yeah, do we wanna incorporate the entire product line, every single physical product?
0:54:10.781 --> 0:54:15.101
Luis Escobar
You guys, you know, use across all the locations.
0:54:18.751 --> 0:54:18.791
Basement
I.
0:54:18.791 --> 0:54:20.471
Basement
I don't see personally. Why not.
0:54:21.71 --> 0:54:22.551
Basement
Just just because it would.
0:54:22.631 --> 0:54:28.951
Basement
I mean, at the very least, you have one purchase, you know it's extra 100 few, $100 in revenue.
0:54:30.391 --> 0:54:32.231
Basement
Unless you're just cluttering up the the page.
0:54:33.521 --> 0:54:37.951
Luis Escobar
No, Sir. It makes a big difference if we have a card on file or not, right?
0:54:38.741 --> 0:54:41.261
Luis Escobar
So the conversion rate changes drastically.
0:54:38.991 --> 0:54:39.471
Basement
Yeah.
0:54:41.261 --> 0:54:46.861
Luis Escobar
Actually, you know, if you were asking someone to take out their credit card or sign up again, right?
0:54:46.901 --> 0:54:54.741
Luis Escobar
But if they already have a username and a password and their credit card was already put on file a long time ago and all they got to do is.
0:54:53.351 --> 0:54:55.191
Basement
Yeah, but, but but.
0:54:57.191 --> 0:54:58.71
Basement
We we could also add.
0:55:0.351 --> 0:55:4.71
Basement
What? What Apple Pay here too?
0:55:3.531 --> 0:55:3.731
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:55:4.71 --> 0:55:6.151
Basement
So if you're just a guest.
0:55:5.461 --> 0:55:5.941
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:55:8.231 --> 0:55:10.991
Basement
We we can add Apple Pay as a checkout.
0:55:11.351 --> 0:55:15.71
Basement
I love Apple Pay. I feel like having the products on there too.
0:55:12.11 --> 0:55:13.651
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:55:15.111 --> 0:55:24.711
Basement
We used to have like the supplements if we like really got telehealth going, I feel like that would be a good place for. Yeah, I mean it, it was never meant to be.
0:55:25.221 --> 0:55:48.871
Basement
Be a popular visited site but but. But I mean we would actually pick a prop product or service from Shopify and we would advertise that so so so it more more or less gave us a storefront to do that from that, that that in my mind I mean.
0:55:46.931 --> 0:55:47.451
Luis Escobar
I gotcha.
0:55:48.871 --> 0:55:51.581
Basement
Like we had membership we we were selling.
0:55:53.151 --> 0:55:54.151
Basement
Memberships.
0:55:54.921 --> 0:56:1.41
Basement
Through Shopify, before the way that we do it now, however we do it now.
0:56:1.321 --> 0:56:8.441
Basement
So we, you know, we were selling the assessment on you know on Shopify and then we we would add.
0:56:5.871 --> 0:56:6.71
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:56:11.871 --> 0:56:18.471
Basement
Discount code. You know if we were running a special offer, that kind of thing so.
0:56:17.951 --> 0:56:18.351
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
0:56:21.651 --> 0:56:24.51
Basement
This is kind of not the most important thing.
0:56:24.51 --> 0:56:31.531
Basement
I'm just curious, like when it comes to the product page for like the physical things like the supplements and skin care.
0:56:33.511 --> 0:56:42.551
Basement
Would AI be able to like enhance those like the photos of the supplement bottles? And like the photos of the skin care?
0:56:43.151 --> 0:56:45.351
Basement
Like the photos that we have on there now.
0:56:43.881 --> 0:56:44.561
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:56:47.111 --> 0:56:50.831
Basement
Those, I think those are from their site, but of the skin care.
0:56:51.181 --> 0:56:56.301
Basement
Eris from like our neocutis like portal that they give us access to.
0:56:57.221 --> 0:57:5.701
Basement
So yeah, just curious because as the pictures as they are right now are not worth it to have on a product page just because they're not.
0:57:0.831 --> 0:57:1.231
Luis Escobar
No.
0:57:7.91 --> 0:57:8.291
Luis Escobar
Oh yeah. Good, good point.
0:57:8.291 --> 0:57:8.771
Luis Escobar
I agree.
0:57:8.851 --> 0:57:26.291
Luis Escobar
I mean, yeah, every aspect of of every, you know, the way we're presenting the product, it should be like really well presented on like a high quality image that that if it looks like it's like nobody put effort into it, people don't believe in it like.
0:57:26.301 --> 0:57:27.301
Basement
Yeah, for sure.
0:57:27.951 --> 0:57:34.991
Luis Escobar
Yeah. So yeah, for sure, we'll we'll definitely try to like improve the images that need improvement with with AI.
0:57:39.971 --> 0:57:48.251
Luis Escobar
Is is there. Also is are all those images like also stored in our in Dropbox?
0:57:49.81 --> 0:57:51.481
Basement
Of the like supplements and skin care.
0:57:51.641 --> 0:57:52.241
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:57:53.151 --> 0:57:54.831
Basement
Probably not, no.
0:57:54.831 --> 0:57:59.231
Basement
I don't actually know where the Renzo do you know where those photos of this?
0:58:0.31 --> 0:58:2.631
Basement
Oh well, you probably didn't even do that part.
0:58:2.631 --> 0:58:4.871
Basement
I don't know where the supplement photos came from.
0:58:4.871 --> 0:58:8.831
Basement
Did you turn these into black and white?
0:58:9.551 --> 0:58:11.311
Basement
Was this your idea?
0:58:11.791 --> 0:58:13.31
Basement
It's been like that for a while.
0:58:14.511 --> 0:58:15.351
Basement
I know you hate it.
0:58:15.431 --> 0:58:16.351
Basement
Well, no, no, no.
0:58:16.711 --> 0:58:21.151
Basement
I like it for certain things I I really don't like black and white.
0:58:21.661 --> 0:58:30.541
Basement
When you're bringing things to life, you know, I mean, I think black and white has A to me, you're missing out on on.
0:58:30.541 --> 0:58:40.341
Basement
I mean color is life, you know, to me, and I know these videos with color. And to me it'd be much more compelling, but.
0:58:40.971 --> 0:58:41.171
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:58:42.491 --> 0:58:49.171
Basement
But that's a design thing. Like, right? I mean, that's just there's a lot of things wrong with the this website.
0:58:43.121 --> 0:58:43.481
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:58:49.171 --> 0:58:52.491
Basement
So that was kinda just. That's not even meant to be on every page.
0:58:52.491 --> 0:58:56.931
Basement
That was just kind of a, you know, that's on, like the aesthetics home page.
0:58:57.651 --> 0:58:57.891
Luis Escobar
Uh H.
0:58:58.871 --> 0:59:1.191
Basement
So yeah, but I get what you're saying.
0:59:1.111 --> 0:59:1.471
Luis Escobar
All good.
0:59:1.471 --> 0:59:3.991
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we're. Yeah, we're gonna cover all that.
0:59:2.911 --> 0:59:6.671
Basement
But I can look for those supplement in skin care photos for you.
0:59:6.671 --> 0:59:8.591
Basement
I don't really know where to find them but.
0:59:7.21 --> 0:59:7.701
Luis Escobar
Yeah, please.
0:59:7.701 --> 0:59:8.621
Luis Escobar
That helps.
0:59:9.981 --> 0:59:14.61
Luis Escobar
Yeah, all all the imagery you can provide that that really helps.
0:59:15.61 --> 0:59:16.101
Luis Escobar
Just to move things along.
0:59:15.311 --> 0:59:16.71
Basement
Why don't?
0:59:16.71 --> 0:59:18.511
Basement
Why don't I send you some notes as well?
0:59:18.881 --> 0:59:19.41
Brian Hyatt
OK.
0:59:19.911 --> 0:59:29.791
Basement
On you know the the 92nd infomercial pre pre pre flight video that tells our brand story etc etc.
0:59:30.921 --> 0:59:31.601
Luis Escobar
Please do.
0:59:31.751 --> 0:59:35.191
Basement
I could start start to give you some insight into that.
0:59:36.951 --> 0:59:37.271
Basement
To where?
0:59:37.311 --> 0:59:41.911
Basement
Maybe we can have AI do a podcast script or whatever that we can follow.
0:59:46.701 --> 0:59:48.741
Luis Escobar
And and do we have like?
0:59:51.71 --> 0:59:51.271
Luis Escobar
Video.
0:59:51.981 --> 1:0:5.701
Luis Escobar
Recording of this 100 biomarker health assessment. Like I'm I'm, I'm picturing like like AB roll like a a 22nd slow motion B roll. But basically this girl and this guy were just video.
0:59:56.851 --> 0:59:57.771
Basement
Yeah, we.
1:0:9.381 --> 1:0:14.101
Basement
I would say there's some stuff that Gabo did when he was here.
1:0:14.101 --> 1:0:14.821
Basement
It's not.
1:0:14.821 --> 1:0:19.861
Basement
No, there's what she did with me. Like, I mean, I will sit in the chair.
1:0:19.861 --> 1:0:24.141
Basement
I mean, you know, I mean, I know she's filmed people.
1:0:24.141 --> 1:0:26.271
Basement
Yeah, I mean that, that's what I'm saying.
1:0:26.271 --> 1:0:29.61
Basement
I don't know where all this video that she's taken exists.
1:0:29.741 --> 1:0:31.981
Basement
It is all in Dropbox.
1:0:30.471 --> 1:0:30.871
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
1:0:33.591 --> 1:0:33.671
Basement
OK.
1:0:33.791 --> 1:0:35.551
Basement
Well then, yes, I I we.
1:0:35.671 --> 1:0:37.511
Basement
I didn't know that we had that, but we do.
1:0:37.871 --> 1:0:39.311
Basement
I was thinking of the stuff that Gabriel.
1:0:39.741 --> 1:0:40.421
Basement
On the phone.
1:0:40.421 --> 1:0:43.981
Basement
And that was just, you know.
1:0:44.21 --> 1:0:45.661
Basement
No, you don't even need to take a look at those.
1:0:47.831 --> 1:0:48.551
Basement
But yeah.
1:0:48.441 --> 1:0:49.281
Luis Escobar
Alright, perfect.
1:0:49.281 --> 1:0:52.841
Luis Escobar
Perfect. That definitely will just keep building up on that.
1:0:53.861 --> 1:0:54.301
Basement
This week.
1:0:54.551 --> 1:0:55.231
Luis Escobar
Solid.
1:0:56.881 --> 1:1:8.401
Basement
But I mean, we have tons of, I don't know how organized right where we see Pam or Doctor Reyes or Vivien, we could definitely have instead of some stock photography.
1:1:8.521 --> 1:1:14.1
Basement
Doctor Who, we could definitely have one of our yeah providers there.
1:1:14.1 --> 1:1:21.881
Basement
Yeah. I think one also issue that we cannot have with some of the photos that we have is our providers offices aren't the most like.
1:1:22.991 --> 1:1:26.671
Basement
You know they have, like personal photos and and stuff like that.
1:1:27.501 --> 1:1:35.341
Basement
I think for the most part, we when we would shoot photos or videos or whatever, we would move a lot of the stuff out of the way.
1:1:35.841 --> 1:1:36.41
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:1:37.151 --> 1:1:47.191
Basement
But I think that like from a brick and mortar point of view, we could enhance their offices a little bit to make it easier for us to get content without having to rearrange the room first.
1:1:47.951 --> 1:1:56.231
Basement
That's kind of like a hard thing. I don't know. Like where we go with that because also it's their space that they work in every day. Yeah, but.
1:1:48.241 --> 1:1:48.561
Luis Escobar
For sure.
1:1:56.661 --> 1:1:58.61
Basement
We can definitely.
1:1:58.341 --> 1:2:10.821
Basement
I I will definitely we we can just make it a company policy like I mean honestly being German like things have a place.
1:2:10.891 --> 1:2:12.411
Basement
Less is more.
1:2:12.451 --> 1:2:17.571
Basement
I mean like, I'm a very **** kind of like that, that that's so so.
1:2:19.541 --> 1:2:21.621
Basement
I can easily make that a thing, I mean.
1:2:21.741 --> 1:2:22.581
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
1:2:23.581 --> 1:2:25.461
Basement
Yeah, I mean, things have to look clean.
1:2:25.461 --> 1:2:27.541
Basement
They have to look well positioned, yeah.
1:2:27.901 --> 1:2:31.461
Basement
And you have like, a uniform, like everyone's office looks the same.
1:2:28.711 --> 1:2:29.71
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:2:30.541 --> 1:2:30.661
Luis Escobar
But.
1:2:31.501 --> 1:2:40.981
Basement
Yeah. And then I think it would make content a lot easier 'cause, you know, we won't have to say, oh, well, there's a picture of, you know, Pam's daughter in the background or.
1:2:36.101 --> 1:2:36.301
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:2:41.411 --> 1:2:49.931
Basement
I mean, if you step into our office, we have the same lighting, the same chandeliers, the same Scots, the same colors, the same desk.
1:2:50.171 --> 1:2:52.571
Basement
I mean so. So I mean we don't.
1:2:53.91 --> 1:3:5.971
Basement
I mean to to your point, we should accentuate that, you know, and make sure we were clean in every office because that's a big a big like, you know, appeal to our in office.
1:2:57.741 --> 1:2:58.141
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:3:1.891 --> 1:3:2.571
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:3:3.941 --> 1:3:4.341
Luis Escobar
So.
1:3:7.101 --> 1:3:7.861
Luis Escobar
Especially right here.
1:3:7.861 --> 1:3:10.61
Luis Escobar
This is the four step process right?
1:3:10.61 --> 1:3:13.421
Luis Escobar
It's just exactly what to expect essentially, right?
1:3:12.121 --> 1:3:12.921
Basement
Don't send me no.
1:3:14.981 --> 1:3:28.421
Luis Escobar
You know this should be like a also like a a slow MO video like a a person on their laptop or on their computer clicking Apple Pay and signing up to enuh health like nine second video clip.
1:3:16.491 --> 1:3:17.251
Basement
This is.
1:3:26.971 --> 1:3:27.651
Basement
This is.
1:3:30.91 --> 1:3:33.531
Basement
This is probably more of like the flow of our telehealth membership.
1:3:34.1 --> 1:3:34.201
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:3:35.101 --> 1:3:36.381
Basement
Oh, you're on the telehealth number, Ron.
1:3:36.381 --> 1:3:37.381
Basement
Sorry, yeah.
1:3:36.881 --> 1:3:37.801
Luis Escobar
I think so, yeah.
1:3:37.381 --> 1:3:55.101
Basement
So it looks a little different than the in person one, just because like in person they don't start with the purchase they purchase like at their and there there's no reason to have a photo of me and Lisa and Kagan on there.
1:3:55.101 --> 1:3:57.661
Basement
I mean that's that doesn't sell anybody.
1:3:57.661 --> 1:3:59.181
Basement
I don't think I don't.
1:3:59.381 --> 1:4:0.941
Basement
I think that that's part of.
1:4:1.211 --> 1:4:6.251
Basement
Story. But I mean, I don't think that that's enough to take up space.
1:4:5.571 --> 1:4:9.691
Luis Escobar
Oh, there's a there's a place on the website for that, right?
1:4:9.811 --> 1:4:10.691
Luis Escobar
So you wanna?
1:4:10.191 --> 1:4:10.591
Basement
Yeah.
1:4:10.691 --> 1:4:14.211
Luis Escobar
Yeah. We really wanna make use of every pixel.
1:4:14.871 --> 1:4:15.831
Basement
Yeah.
1:4:15.741 --> 1:4:16.61
Luis Escobar
All right.
1:4:18.811 --> 1:4:19.611
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I mean, right.
1:4:19.651 --> 1:4:22.691
Luis Escobar
So right here I'm looking at your in person membership.
1:4:29.221 --> 1:4:33.981
Luis Escobar
And so, I mean, nobody's landing on here and clicking this, right?
1:4:30.551 --> 1:4:30.631
Basement
I I.
1:4:33.501 --> 1:4:33.701
Basement
Don't.
1:4:35.951 --> 1:4:38.431
Basement
There was one scene.
1:4:38.431 --> 1:4:45.551
Basement
There are a shot where it says, you know, telehealth versus in person.
1:4:45.591 --> 1:4:51.911
Basement
It's almost like we're competing with each other. You know, telehealth is at a much lower, lower price.
1:4:56.151 --> 1:4:56.351
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:4:56.521 --> 1:5:3.201
Basement
But but I don't like the feeling of the look of on our site or comparing to each other, you know.
1:5:3.991 --> 1:5:4.191
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:5:5.301 --> 1:5:8.741
Basement
Even though you you want to sell both and you wanted to to display both.
1:5:12.31 --> 1:5:13.391
Basement
You know it needs to be.
1:5:15.381 --> 1:5:16.261
Basement
You know, we're really pick.
1:5:16.261 --> 1:5:19.501
Basement
Pick the service level that's right for you, I guess.
1:5:19.781 --> 1:5:23.141
Basement
But I don't like saying what's not included.
1:5:25.431 --> 1:5:30.231
Basement
Although you have to, I guess, be able to justify why you're charging more.
1:5:31.231 --> 1:5:31.631
Basement
So.
1:5:31.591 --> 1:5:32.231
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I know.
1:5:32.391 --> 1:5:35.471
Luis Escobar
We gotta make it more make sense, right?
1:5:37.181 --> 1:5:40.141
Luis Escobar
And and so look, I just made this image into a video.
1:5:41.901 --> 1:5:42.381
Luis Escobar
This image.
1:5:59.511 --> 1:6:0.231
Basement
How are you doing?
1:6:2.171 --> 1:6:2.611
Basement
Yeah.
1:6:3.581 --> 1:6:6.341
Renzo Mogrovejo
The user generated it right now.
1:6:7.151 --> 1:6:7.871
Luis Escobar
Yeah, just now.
1:6:9.11 --> 1:6:9.211
Renzo Mogrovejo
Wow.
1:6:12.301 --> 1:6:17.741
Luis Escobar
So yeah, if I can get my hands on all the imagery you have, right, and we'll, we'll make some videos out of them.
1:6:19.821 --> 1:6:23.701
Luis Escobar
It just expresses the message better. Right now I understand what.
1:6:26.51 --> 1:6:28.851
Luis Escobar
Expecting maybe the getting pinched is not the best.
1:6:31.171 --> 1:6:31.611
Luis Escobar
Video.
1:6:34.141 --> 1:6:36.861
Luis Escobar
But yeah, that's more video as much video as we can.
1:6:36.901 --> 1:6:38.861
Luis Escobar
We see life force has a bunch of video everywhere.
1:6:40.951 --> 1:6:45.71
Basement
It's a small thing, but the capitalization on our page drives me crazy too.
1:6:45.71 --> 1:6:46.31
Basement
I I yeah.
1:6:47.391 --> 1:6:47.871
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:6:54.901 --> 1:6:56.461
Luis Escobar
We're gonna revamp all this.
1:6:55.31 --> 1:6:56.191
Basement
Random capital letters.
1:6:57.861 --> 1:7:1.381
Basement
That's just random words capitalized.
1:7:4.521 --> 1:7:5.241
Luis Escobar
So.
1:7:6.971 --> 1:7:7.251
Basement
Hello.
1:7:7.741 --> 1:7:10.501
Luis Escobar
Does each does each location right now have their own website?
1:7:12.411 --> 1:7:13.91
Basement
No.
1:7:14.341 --> 1:7:14.701
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:7:15.901 --> 1:7:17.181
Basement
I'm speaking out of turn there.
1:7:19.411 --> 1:7:20.651
Luis Escobar
No, I believe, yeah, we should get.
1:7:23.101 --> 1:7:23.701
Luis Escobar
New life.
1:7:25.341 --> 1:7:30.61
Luis Escobar
Springhurst.com new life for creek.com newlifelexington.com.
1:7:34.91 --> 1:7:37.771
Luis Escobar
And really drive home the idea of new life, right?
1:7:37.771 --> 1:7:43.131
Luis Escobar
We we want these local members right, even though they're local, we want them to go home and tell their friends.
1:7:43.131 --> 1:7:44.931
Luis Escobar
Hey, you gotta download the new life app.
1:7:51.771 --> 1:7:52.811
Luis Escobar
What is it?
1:7:52.811 --> 1:7:53.11
Luis Escobar
It's a it's a.
1:7:53.11 --> 1:7:57.571
Luis Escobar
It's not a if you want a new life, you download the new Life app.
1:8:0.761 --> 1:8:4.681
Luis Escobar
We gotta start playing with these different, you know, different approaches, right?
1:8:14.741 --> 1:8:18.501
Luis Escobar
I was mentioning to Brian earlier that like you know, if we really just like.
1:8:20.391 --> 1:8:25.231
Luis Escobar
Work at a pretty good pace. We can have an app on the iOS store.
1:8:26.571 --> 1:8:29.931
Luis Escobar
Four to six months right 1.0 version.
1:8:32.301 --> 1:8:44.381
Luis Escobar
You know, maybe it doesn't have all the building features and whistles, but that's how we invite our the initial, you know, 100 Members, the friends and family, the loyal customers.
1:8:44.381 --> 1:8:51.61
Luis Escobar
And then we're gonna get all the feedback we need from them in regards to like, you know what they wanna see this app do? What?
1:8:51.461 --> 1:8:55.21
Luis Escobar
How they would like to see it designed or or.
1:8:56.501 --> 1:8:56.981
Luis Escobar
You know what?
1:8:57.21 --> 1:8:58.701
Luis Escobar
What kinds of features they would like to see?
1:8:59.761 --> 1:9:1.161
Luis Escobar
So it's kind of like my my.
1:9:15.871 --> 1:9:15.991
Luis Escobar
Umm.
1:9:19.711 --> 1:9:31.551
Luis Escobar
The 90 minute video also, that's sorry, the 92nd video Ted or or two-minute video, however long it is, it should just be a short video that really drives home the message of who we are and what we do.
1:9:33.61 --> 1:9:37.461
Luis Escobar
That's also a pretty crucial component of of the initial marketing, right?
1:9:37.461 --> 1:9:39.221
Luis Escobar
It's gonna set the tone for everything else.
1:9:44.421 --> 1:9:53.61
Basement
Do you see that VM like a fast-paced, fast moving energy type thing? Or is it more of a podcast?
1:9:54.581 --> 1:9:56.421
Basement
Conversation or?
1:9:54.791 --> 1:9:54.911
Luis Escobar
You.
1:9:56.651 --> 1:9:59.731
Luis Escobar
No more high. Yeah, fast-paced.
1:10:2.771 --> 1:10:3.891
Luis Escobar
Emotional triggers.
1:10:6.531 --> 1:10:9.131
Luis Escobar
Borderline like.
1:10:6.711 --> 1:10:7.71
Basement
Come.
1:10:10.541 --> 1:10:11.181
Luis Escobar
Wow. Amazing. Like.
1:10:11.821 --> 1:10:12.301
Basement
Yeah.
1:10:13.341 --> 1:10:14.541
Luis Escobar
Really don't.
1:10:14.541 --> 1:10:15.541
Luis Escobar
Not exaggerated, but it's it's.
1:10:15.741 --> 1:10:18.261
Luis Escobar
You know, it can look away.
1:10:20.771 --> 1:10:21.171
Basement
What?
1:10:25.871 --> 1:10:27.111
Luis Escobar
I'm happy to help with that, right?
1:10:27.111 --> 1:10:30.31
Luis Escobar
But if you can share your initial thoughts and and copyright.
1:10:31.701 --> 1:10:32.21
Luis Escobar
Give you my two cents.
1:10:33.141 --> 1:10:33.541
Basement
Jim.
1:10:37.931 --> 1:10:39.971
Basement
There there was an there was an.
1:10:38.81 --> 1:10:38.601
Luis Escobar
But yeah, I'm.
1:10:40.611 --> 1:10:45.811
Basement
There there was a video that we paid to have done that announced the brand change.
1:10:46.51 --> 1:10:47.931
Basement
I don't know where we put that.
1:10:47.931 --> 1:10:52.811
Basement
Did you see that it was at the end of that PowerPoint presentation I sent you before we met?
1:10:54.501 --> 1:10:58.181
Basement
On the very first PowerPoint, yeah, there was a drop box.
1:10:58.181 --> 1:11:2.101
Basement
There was a link to it at the on the very last page or second last page I believe.
1:11:6.21 --> 1:11:7.221
Basement
I don't know if that one.
1:11:7.931 --> 1:11:12.771
Basement
Maybe that similar vibe, but that one mentions 25 again and Nava's logo.
1:11:12.931 --> 1:11:22.11
Basement
It's different, meaning it's different but but, but it's a it's A and that that's a pretty in intense vibe.
1:11:14.841 --> 1:11:15.41
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:11:23.541 --> 1:11:26.421
Basement
You know where where this one would be more.
1:11:28.321 --> 1:11:30.81
Basement
Professional. Heartfelt.
1:11:32.541 --> 1:11:33.181
Basement
Kind of thing so.
1:11:34.741 --> 1:11:35.141
Luis Escobar
I got you.
1:11:39.91 --> 1:11:43.691
Luis Escobar
Can can we just set up the Google Workspace now? It takes like 2 seconds.
1:11:45.261 --> 1:11:45.781
Luis Escobar
Think I'll just.
1:11:47.941 --> 1:11:48.621
Luis Escobar
Here.
1:11:52.101 --> 1:12:0.861
Luis Escobar
We live, but I really wanna get you and and the team using Gemini. I mean that that little video I just generated that was Gemini.
1:12:8.861 --> 1:12:10.461
Basement
Dot coor.com there.
1:12:11.421 --> 1:12:11.781
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:12:44.301 --> 1:12:49.661
Luis Escobar
So. So the big thing with workspace. You see my screen. You see all these different drop downs.
1:12:51.181 --> 1:13:2.501
Luis Escobar
These are different team members from different companies basically, but I have a a way to like make sure that everyone has all the resources they need inside of their Chrome, right?
1:13:3.61 --> 1:13:5.181
Luis Escobar
And with Gemini, it just makes it so easy.
1:13:6.981 --> 1:13:13.141
Luis Escobar
You know, the idea is for every team member to have their own AI, basically helping them, you know, with their day-to-day operations.
1:13:13.971 --> 1:13:14.91
Luis Escobar
Yes.
1:13:16.941 --> 1:13:18.701
Luis Escobar
This is a Google Labs.
1:13:26.921 --> 1:13:28.441
Luis Escobar
All these are different AIS.
1:13:30.581 --> 1:13:33.421
Luis Escobar
For audio, for video recording.
1:13:36.651 --> 1:13:40.331
Luis Escobar
You know, like a a a 3D animation type video.
1:13:40.371 --> 1:13:42.771
Luis Escobar
That could be something to to think about.
1:13:45.811 --> 1:13:47.131
Luis Escobar
Now we have.
1:13:47.251 --> 1:13:49.411
Luis Escobar
You know it's it's a great time to create content.
1:13:49.411 --> 1:13:51.651
Luis Escobar
This was not possible eight months ago.
1:13:54.991 --> 1:13:55.871
Basement
Superco.
1:13:56.581 --> 1:13:57.421
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
1:13:58.301 --> 1:13:58.381
Basement
Nd.
1:14:3.741 --> 1:14:5.61
Luis Escobar
There's a lot of work to do.
1:14:6.581 --> 1:14:7.141
Luis Escobar
I got I got my.
1:14:7.181 --> 1:14:11.21
Luis Escobar
I got my plate pulled, but I'm excited guys starting just with the website, right?
1:14:11.21 --> 1:14:14.821
Luis Escobar
And then we're gonna evolve to the app and and all the other things.
1:14:17.61 --> 1:14:24.461
Luis Escobar
I I do wanna make sure that you know that the HubSpot is is getting all the data it needs.
1:14:25.221 --> 1:14:29.501
Luis Escobar
Can can we schedule a meeting tomorrow just for the data migration?
1:14:31.221 --> 1:14:31.901
Luis Escobar
Initiative.
1:14:33.721 --> 1:14:34.521
Basement
Sure.
1:14:35.121 --> 1:14:35.241
Luis Escobar
Mm H.
1:14:41.441 --> 1:14:43.561
Luis Escobar
What would be a good time?
1:14:44.891 --> 1:14:47.451
Basement
I think I just have something at 10 and that's.
1:14:49.51 --> 1:14:50.451
Basement
The only thing I have.
1:14:52.931 --> 1:14:54.51
Basement
Preferably after that.
1:14:55.121 --> 1:14:56.321
Luis Escobar
Preferably after.
1:14:58.91 --> 1:14:58.771
Basement
Oh yeah.
1:15:0.501 --> 1:15:1.741
Luis Escobar
I can do 11.
1:15:3.331 --> 1:15:3.931
Luis Escobar
I am.
1:15:5.341 --> 1:15:5.941
Basement
That works.
1:15:8.481 --> 1:15:8.841
Luis Escobar
Great.
1:15:8.831 --> 1:15:10.471
Basement
For those that work for you.
1:15:11.151 --> 1:15:11.791
Luis Escobar
Hours.
1:15:14.501 --> 1:15:14.621
Luis Escobar
Umm.
1:15:15.841 --> 1:15:15.921
Renzo Mogrovejo
Oh.
1:15:18.731 --> 1:15:19.731
Renzo Mogrovejo
Which one, sorry.
1:15:21.901 --> 1:15:24.261
Basement
11:00 AM does that work for you tomorrow, Renzo?
1:15:26.21 --> 1:15:26.101
Renzo Mogrovejo
Ed.
1:15:27.531 --> 1:15:27.971
Renzo Mogrovejo
Gemini.
1:15:30.271 --> 1:15:30.831
Basement
Yeah.
1:15:30.441 --> 1:15:31.161
Luis Escobar
11:00 AM.
1:15:34.471 --> 1:15:35.111
Renzo Mogrovejo
Oh yeah.
1:15:53.491 --> 1:15:54.131
Basement
OK so.
1:15:55.941 --> 1:15:56.861
Basement
Next steps as far as.
1:15:59.461 --> 1:16:2.381
Basement
Clickup is concerned. I guess we're gonna.
1:16:5.521 --> 1:16:8.881
Basement
We have to do something before proposing it to Louis.
1:16:10.741 --> 1:16:13.861
Basement
I mean, no, I don't think we're really like proposing it.
1:16:13.861 --> 1:16:17.741
Basement
We're kind of just like we just want you to take a look at it.
1:16:17.741 --> 1:16:19.621
Basement
We don't have the subtasks.
1:16:18.381 --> 1:16:18.581
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:16:19.661 --> 1:16:25.341
Basement
It's based off of what we talked about yesterday. So it's just kind of like the first steps.
1:16:22.901 --> 1:16:23.101
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:16:26.101 --> 1:16:26.301
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:16:26.821 --> 1:16:32.581
Basement
Obviously we have that admin access. That one's done. I think the bottom two are.
1:16:34.531 --> 1:16:44.131
Basement
Hang on, sorry. Let me look. I guess what I'm saying is like I view that as being like the one place where we can delegate, right?
1:16:44.131 --> 1:16:53.971
Basement
Delegate task, assign a date and make sure that that nobody's holding us up from achieving what we want to and the time that we think it should take.
1:16:54.51 --> 1:16:56.131
Basement
So. So that's right.
1:16:56.131 --> 1:16:59.931
Basement
Yeah. So, so the two tasks that we've put on there so far.
1:17:0.861 --> 1:17:3.821
Basement
Are the data migration slash integration?
1:17:4.211 --> 1:17:6.771
Basement
And then integrate AI for operations.
1:17:6.771 --> 1:17:20.171
Basement
So that's air call, chat bots, intercom, slack. Those are the top two from the list that we pulled from the like Louis tasks list.
1:17:11.341 --> 1:17:11.541
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:17:14.731 --> 1:17:15.211
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:17:20.211 --> 1:17:21.691
Basement
Those are the 1st 2 steps.
1:17:20.661 --> 1:17:20.861
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:17:23.141 --> 1:17:24.461
Basement
Anything else?
1:17:24.561 --> 1:17:26.41
Luis Escobar
Perfect. Yeah.
1:17:25.221 --> 1:17:31.701
Basement
What what you just said? The two tasks they're under to do right now. Oh, OK.
1:17:26.41 --> 1:17:27.441
Luis Escobar
And I already have the admin.
1:17:31.701 --> 1:17:33.101
Basement
So. So they're now on screen.
1:17:33.971 --> 1:17:42.691
Basement
There's huge set to Scroll down to the bottom OK and then we've all been kind of in meetings here and there all day.
1:17:42.691 --> 1:17:50.891
Basement
So I think that the adding of the subtasks will be done tomorrow, but like Steven and Renzo are going to go in together for those two.
1:17:52.341 --> 1:17:58.141
Basement
Because they're kind of going to be the ones leading that and Add all of the tasks that they need to do tomorrow 11:00 AM.
1:18:0.61 --> 1:18:0.621
Basement
And then.
1:18:2.381 --> 1:18:2.541
Basement
Yeah.
1:18:3.51 --> 1:18:7.131
Basement
Yeah, those are the first two that we have to start with before anything else happens.
1:18:7.971 --> 1:18:19.811
Basement
We also have like a task on the task list for the website, but we don't really have anything to contribute to the website yet until we get that like 1.0 version of it.
1:18:14.401 --> 1:18:14.481
Luis Escobar
Mm.
1:18:19.811 --> 1:18:22.291
Basement
So this is just kind of a starting point.
1:18:20.351 --> 1:18:20.551
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:18:24.141 --> 1:18:28.221
Basement
Before anything else happens, so and obviously this is for two weeks.
1:18:29.531 --> 1:18:30.51
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
1:18:29.901 --> 1:18:31.581
Basement
So we also have tasks.
1:18:31.581 --> 1:18:33.341
Basement
We created a status that's ongoing.
1:18:34.811 --> 1:18:47.971
Basement
Steven already had some ongoing tasks that we moved to that status and then I'm sure a lot of the stuff that we're gonna start is gonna kind of live in that ongoing status because it's not gonna be done within a two week period.
1:18:52.511 --> 1:18:56.231
Luis Escobar
Noted. Noted. Yeah, no, this is taking good shape already.
1:18:56.311 --> 1:18:57.111
Luis Escobar
From what I can see.
1:19:0.711 --> 1:19:3.231
Luis Escobar
I'm curious about these no show automations.
1:19:5.21 --> 1:19:6.501
Luis Escobar
That that is a high priority.
1:19:8.231 --> 1:19:14.71
Basement
Yes, I got that on there. It it kind of like works in a little.
1:19:15.741 --> 1:19:22.621
Basement
Right now what we're doing is taking for like our aesthetic booking page. We're taking $25.00 deposit fee.
1:19:22.621 --> 1:19:37.381
Basement
The idea was change that to where we're taking a no show fee afterwards, but we need to get where it's communicating. A broken appointments correctly so that we could send an invoice in HubSpot and then we're also trying to make sure that we can save that card.
1:19:37.381 --> 1:19:37.741
Basement
On file.
1:19:38.331 --> 1:19:44.691
Basement
And charge it. I think we should have a problem saving the card on file.
1:19:44.691 --> 1:19:50.51
Basement
I I'm pretty sure we have that enabled now, but yeah, we're just trying to get that set.
1:19:46.101 --> 1:19:46.261
Brian Hyatt
OK.
1:19:50.51 --> 1:19:54.371
Basement
So we we don't charge the $25 at the time of the booking.
1:19:54.371 --> 1:20:2.171
Basement
We do OK, but I wanted to change it where it would be like AI. Think it the way it would have to work would be a $1.00 like card verification fee.
1:20:2.171 --> 1:20:3.611
Basement
That would hopefully would set.
1:20:4.381 --> 1:20:9.741
Basement
Your set like maybe some custom field like oh we have a card on file or existing customer.
1:20:9.891 --> 1:20:10.771
Basement
Or something like that.
1:20:10.771 --> 1:20:21.651
Basement
And HubSpot and then we would know not to send them to that payment link, but just to let them book and then we could charge the card on file if they if they broke the appointment but.
1:20:13.431 --> 1:20:14.151
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:20:22.571 --> 1:20:24.851
Luis Escobar
So I I do.
1:20:23.421 --> 1:20:26.341
Basement
Yeah, that kind of got pushed off. Sorry, go ahead.
1:20:26.661 --> 1:20:32.901
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I do know that HubSpot requires at at least a $0.50 transaction to save the card on file.
1:20:33.801 --> 1:20:42.921
Basement
Right. Yeah, that was that was the idea with the like, the one time card verification fee. And I I just don't know if we can like set.
1:20:44.461 --> 1:20:54.581
Basement
Set some custom field or like check to see if there is a card on file to know like to not send them to the payment link or to send them to directly the booking page.
1:20:54.581 --> 1:20:55.541
Basement
I don't really know but.
1:20:57.421 --> 1:21:3.661
Basement
That was kind of a part of a bigger integration to where whether the appointment would be completed or not.
1:21:4.211 --> 1:21:9.91
Basement
Code the well the the No show status.
1:21:10.501 --> 1:21:10.901
Basement
Would if.
1:21:10.901 --> 1:21:17.781
Basement
There, if it was an aesthetic appointment, you supposed to, we would be taking the no show fee after we change that around.
1:21:19.541 --> 1:21:22.981
Basement
And then send them like create some tasks, send an e-mail.
1:21:24.581 --> 1:21:25.781
Basement
That like, sorry we missed you.
1:21:27.701 --> 1:21:29.301
Basement
Click here to reschedule.
1:21:29.501 --> 1:21:34.221
Basement
Or if it was a if it was a like a baseline for like a health assessment appointment that was broken.
1:21:34.451 --> 1:21:41.91
Basement
Then should have or. We wanted to create a task for one of the MC as to reach out immediately to that person.
1:21:42.541 --> 1:21:56.221
Basement
And then likewise, if it's like a continuing medical appointment, it should. We want it to be able to notify the practice manager somehow, although they should already know that they didn't know show because they work in the office. But.
1:21:58.61 --> 1:22:6.181
Basement
Yeah. And then on the on the other side of that, if they did show up, we well regardless of if they showed up or not, we would wanna update the deal.
1:22:6.491 --> 1:22:18.251
Basement
Amount on that was created when they purchased with the total amount of the payments that are attached to the procedures that are on that appointment procedures.
1:22:18.251 --> 1:22:23.51
Basement
It's like whether it's services or products, we have procedures, procedure codes.
1:22:23.811 --> 1:22:45.61
Basement
So that was that was part of that was kind of the bigger automation was like whenever the whatever the appointment is completed or no showed whatever move whatever relevant information we need to HubSpot basically whether that's creating a task or updating a status or charging the no.
1:22:24.681 --> 1:22:25.201
Luis Escobar
I follow.
1:22:39.501 --> 1:22:39.941
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
1:22:45.51 --> 1:22:45.291
Basement
Show fee.
1:22:46.541 --> 1:22:52.661
Luis Escobar
Gotcha. Gotcha. And so the the OM that's the the database.
1:22:46.851 --> 1:22:47.91
Basement
So.
1:22:53.191 --> 1:22:56.471
Basement
Yeah. We open open medical.
1:22:56.471 --> 1:22:57.871
Basement
It's really open dental.
1:22:57.871 --> 1:23:1.111
Basement
We just call it open medical because we're a medical practice.
1:23:1.151 --> 1:23:4.191
Basement
It's open dental on every website you'll ever see.
1:23:1.811 --> 1:23:2.291
Luis Escobar
Got it.
1:23:4.311 --> 1:23:7.431
Basement
No one calls it open medical besides us, so.
1:23:5.81 --> 1:23:5.201
Luis Escobar
Hmm.
1:23:7.991 --> 1:23:8.271
Luis Escobar
Got it.
1:23:10.331 --> 1:23:10.571
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:23:10.571 --> 1:23:15.451
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'm. I'm curious to see just the inner workings of it that API and how it works, right?
1:23:17.91 --> 1:23:18.371
Luis Escobar
I think there's a lot we can do there.
1:23:20.691 --> 1:23:24.651
Luis Escobar
We may need to bring in to the play like Stripe.
1:23:24.651 --> 1:23:26.11
Luis Escobar
Do you guys have a stripe account?
1:23:29.181 --> 1:23:32.141
Basement
Yes, I think, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1:23:32.631 --> 1:23:34.311
Luis Escobar
You do OK, 'cause.
1:23:34.311 --> 1:23:38.751
Luis Escobar
Yeah, the the HubSpot Commerce API is is a fairly new.
1:23:40.251 --> 1:23:40.371
Luis Escobar
API.
1:23:40.371 --> 1:23:46.251
Luis Escobar
It's, you know, they they just released this like a year or two ago. And it's they're just using.
1:23:46.251 --> 1:23:49.91
Luis Escobar
They're building on top of the the stripe technology.
1:23:49.91 --> 1:23:50.731
Luis Escobar
Actually, they're just a stripe reseller.
1:23:52.531 --> 1:23:55.131
Luis Escobar
So there's a few advantages of when we're using the.
1:23:57.611 --> 1:24:0.771
Luis Escobar
The core stripe account has the the source.
1:24:1.821 --> 1:24:5.621
Basement
You do have to layer stripe with another.
1:24:7.491 --> 1:24:11.771
Basement
Something another if you're gonna self pharmaceutical.
1:24:13.571 --> 1:24:19.491
Basement
Because Stripe will disallow any sale of, you know meds, so.
1:24:20.501 --> 1:24:21.181
Luis Escobar
I figured.
1:24:23.761 --> 1:24:33.801
Basement
So for like tribe Tri pods, the whole idea behind Tri Pods was kind of an asynchronous that this is what I want.
1:24:24.401 --> 1:24:24.961
Luis Escobar
That's it.
1:24:34.321 --> 1:24:43.401
Basement
Or, you know, good, good, better, best kind of for hair. Erectile function, much like hims and hers kind of thing.
1:24:45.941 --> 1:24:49.221
Luis Escobar
Gotcha. I'll do some research on that. It makes sense.
1:25:2.521 --> 1:25:6.921
Basement
You need what do you need from us or from me specifically?
1:25:8.471 --> 1:25:15.551
Luis Escobar
Well, yeah. When? When? When you have those notes on that 90. Oh, second video. 2 minute video. Can you share that?
1:25:15.441 --> 1:25:15.801
Basement
Go, go.
1:25:17.51 --> 1:25:21.411
Luis Escobar
For the website I I I have what I need for now.
1:25:24.331 --> 1:25:28.331
Luis Escobar
Kather new life domain that I've been connect now to the Google Workspace.
1:25:33.881 --> 1:25:37.121
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I I try free for 14 days. Just do that.
1:25:39.831 --> 1:25:44.151
Luis Escobar
Trenton, I can reconvene on, on e-mail and then we can put a card on file.
1:25:59.671 --> 1:26:0.871
Luis Escobar
Put all this in there.
1:26:5.891 --> 1:26:7.971
Luis Escobar
One looks like it won't let me proceed without it.
1:26:11.251 --> 1:26:18.251
Luis Escobar
Trent Eno, you now. I guess. Or or you want to share the card or do you want to log in yourself and do it?
1:26:19.891 --> 1:26:19.971
Luis Escobar
Or.
1:26:22.911 --> 1:26:24.271
Basement
But I'm sorry.
1:26:26.561 --> 1:26:27.481
Basement
Sorry man, I was.
1:26:27.521 --> 1:26:29.761
Basement
I was looking at something real quick. What was that question?
1:26:30.961 --> 1:26:35.681
Luis Escobar
Regards to adding the payment method or the Google Workspace that we need.
1:26:36.861 --> 1:26:38.61
Basement
Oh yeah, I can.
1:26:38.461 --> 1:26:43.901
Basement
You can either send me a link, I can get it set up, or I can share card information. Whatever. Yeah, whatever works.
1:26:45.191 --> 1:26:47.791
Luis Escobar
Yeah, if you don't just sharing it and then I can just punch it in.
1:26:50.281 --> 1:26:56.121
Basement
Let me send you a I'll just text you a picture of it front and back.
1:26:55.531 --> 1:26:57.171
Luis Escobar
Perfect. Perfect.
1:26:58.101 --> 1:26:58.701
Basement
Let me go.
1:26:59.561 --> 1:27:0.521
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'll get that.
1:27:1.201 --> 1:27:2.521
Luis Escobar
I'll get that all sorted.
1:27:1.931 --> 1:27:3.291
Basement
Oh, here, here. You all do it.
1:27:6.1 --> 1:27:7.41
Basement
Sorry, it's upstairs.
1:27:9.731 --> 1:27:15.971
Luis Escobar
And the overall like you know site map that that was in that document that I shared, right?
1:27:19.111 --> 1:27:22.471
Luis Escobar
Essentially, we we wanna have all these URLs right?
1:27:23.71 --> 1:27:25.431
Luis Escobar
And they should all be SCO optimized.
1:27:31.771 --> 1:27:32.651
Luis Escobar
Services.
1:27:34.131 --> 1:27:34.731
Luis Escobar
Needing that.
1:27:45.621 --> 1:27:57.101
Luis Escobar
Do do you guys have any like calculators? Like kinda like the idea we're referring to earlier about like the the point system. But do you have any existing calculators?
1:27:59.31 --> 1:28:1.311
Basement
Wasn't there abmi?
1:28:2.231 --> 1:28:4.631
Basement
Yeah, calculator that we had.
1:28:4.631 --> 1:28:20.111
Basement
And then the questionnaire that it took you through basically telling you whether or not you're pre qualified for semaglutide or whatever. But it and it took into account your height and weight and your and basically what about the like hormone health survey it would.
1:28:14.121 --> 1:28:14.281
Brian Hyatt
OK.
1:28:19.581 --> 1:28:21.101
Ximena Livia
We have also one for TRT.
1:28:23.41 --> 1:28:24.761
Basement
And one for TRT as well.
1:28:24.761 --> 1:28:29.721
Basement
Yeah. So, So what was cool about the hormone health survey?
1:28:29.921 --> 1:28:33.81
Basement
And it looks bad.
1:28:33.81 --> 1:28:46.921
Basement
It's it's a wonky if you go to 25 fiveagain.com the hormone surveys on there. What's cool is you complete it and it tells you whether.
1:28:47.851 --> 1:28:51.891
Basement
You're likely probable or whatever.
1:28:53.601 --> 1:28:58.121
Basement
Hormone So what?
1:28:58.121 --> 1:29:1.761
Basement
You get out of it is actually really good.
1:29:1.841 --> 1:29:5.841
Basement
I mean and and it gives us a lot to market on, right?
1:29:5.881 --> 1:29:8.481
Basement
So if we know that they don't sleep well.
1:29:10.11 --> 1:29:22.91
Basement
It literally takes, you know, several, several minutes to to go go through but it but but what it what it gives back to them is really cool.
1:29:17.261 --> 1:29:17.381
Luis Escobar
Mm H.
1:29:22.921 --> 1:29:29.641
Basement
And like honestly, you can almost create an AI podcast result of it.
1:29:30.81 --> 1:29:34.321
Basement
I mean, because we say, OK.
1:29:34.321 --> 1:29:39.761
Basement
Yeah, we we ask this but but when you get into like the the meat of it.
1:29:41.371 --> 1:29:47.371
Basement
Like you know, we know whether you sleep well, whether you, you know, whatever, so.
1:29:49.151 --> 1:29:50.631
Luis Escobar
Brilliant. Yeah, I'm gonna.
1:29:52.211 --> 1:29:53.411
Luis Escobar
Use this for sure.
1:29:54.441 --> 1:29:58.281
Basement
Now we have something on one of our pages too. That said, it's like.
1:29:59.931 --> 1:30:4.731
Basement
Your potential weight loss with with a GLP one or something like that.
1:30:4.811 --> 1:30:5.571
Basement
That's what we did.
1:30:5.651 --> 1:30:8.371
Basement
I don't really know what that's based off of, but.
1:30:10.351 --> 1:30:11.31
Basement
Yeah.
1:30:12.691 --> 1:30:13.931
Basement
That might be what runs over say.
1:30:14.971 --> 1:30:15.971
Renzo Mogrovejo
Exactly the same.
1:30:17.401 --> 1:30:22.1
Renzo Mogrovejo
That one is the GLP calculator.
1:30:21.101 --> 1:30:21.221
Luis Escobar
Mm H.
1:30:23.851 --> 1:30:25.651
Renzo Mogrovejo
I just cherry in the chat.
1:30:27.631 --> 1:30:33.151
Luis Escobar
Yeah. So we should have all these fields also being documented in HubSpot, right?
1:30:34.741 --> 1:30:35.701
Brian Hyatt
Yes, they are.
1:30:38.111 --> 1:30:38.751
Luis Escobar
Fantastic.
1:30:39.251 --> 1:30:45.51
Basement
Well, don't. Don't pay nothing for all of them. ****. We have to have something wrong. Wrong with you.
1:30:44.811 --> 1:30:45.891
Luis Escobar
Oh yeah, you're right.
1:30:46.691 --> 1:30:49.451
Basement
I mean we we need, we can't.
1:30:53.131 --> 1:30:53.771
Luis Escobar
That's funny.
1:31:5.461 --> 1:31:19.781
Basement
I had kind of on my like backlog tasks and what's not really something that's like possible right now, but like it would be like a membership savings calculator where hopefully for like especially aesthetic patients.
1:31:21.251 --> 1:31:26.691
Basement
They could like enter in like how many hydrofacials they normally get each year or something like that.
1:31:26.851 --> 1:31:28.331
Basement
Great Run bundle type thing.
1:31:28.411 --> 1:31:33.331
Basement
Yeah, and basically show them what their total savings would be with like their membership discount.
1:31:34.931 --> 1:31:35.251
Basement
And then.
1:31:36.121 --> 1:31:47.841
Basement
Also, like maybe talking about, yeah, maybe thinking about like computing like free, like the average membership saving that that you saved like for with your membership discount overall.
1:31:49.291 --> 1:31:54.11
Basement
Your aesthetic services and products, or whether it's medications or something else but.
1:31:53.851 --> 1:31:54.51
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:31:56.951 --> 1:31:58.191
Basement
We don't really have that data.
1:31:59.311 --> 1:32:1.871
Luis Escobar
I think it's AI think it's a good idea for sure.
1:31:59.651 --> 1:31:59.971
Basement
Or that's.
1:32:3.411 --> 1:32:6.891
Luis Escobar
If you have some notes on that already, we can share on it.
1:32:6.891 --> 1:32:8.651
Luis Escobar
We can definitely.
1:32:10.251 --> 1:32:11.531
Luis Escobar
Bring that project back to life.
1:32:13.371 --> 1:32:19.731
Basement
As you can see, we can make this much better looking, but much more intuitive.
1:32:20.891 --> 1:32:24.531
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it's for sure, but I like it.
1:32:24.961 --> 1:32:26.321
Luis Escobar
You guys have the right idea.
1:32:25.521 --> 1:32:35.601
Basement
Well, well. The result that that you get is really kind of cool because all these questions mean something.
1:32:37.171 --> 1:32:40.251
Basement
Well, the yeah, it doesn't look like yesterday.
1:32:40.251 --> 1:32:42.171
Basement
They can condense this, but.
1:32:44.931 --> 1:32:45.331
Basement
So yeah.
1:32:46.891 --> 1:32:52.571
Basement
It it gives you probable deficiencies, possible deficiencies.
1:33:0.531 --> 1:33:14.731
Basement
This project no, but I mean it's super cool though, especially if you run. If you run these results through AI, you know you you can be able to see.
1:33:5.211 --> 1:33:5.731
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
1:33:13.321 --> 1:33:14.641
Luis Escobar
Yeah, is.
1:33:14.641 --> 1:33:17.841
Luis Escobar
There is there documentation on when this was built.
1:33:16.451 --> 1:33:16.531
Basement
It.
1:33:19.371 --> 1:33:20.571
Luis Escobar
Or whoever built it or.
1:33:21.591 --> 1:33:26.951
Basement
You should should be able to see the back, end it on word, word, word press.
1:33:27.241 --> 1:33:27.561
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:33:28.451 --> 1:33:28.731
Basement
I mean.
1:33:29.51 --> 1:33:30.811
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'll extract everything from there.
1:33:30.731 --> 1:33:31.331
Basement
Yeah.
1:33:32.641 --> 1:33:34.441
Luis Escobar
Not sure if I got that log in.
1:33:35.901 --> 1:33:36.981
Basement
I can get it for you.
1:33:38.251 --> 1:33:38.371
Luis Escobar
See.
1:33:38.451 --> 1:33:39.91
Luis Escobar
Ya ya, I'll need that.
1:33:39.521 --> 1:33:43.401
Brian Hyatt
We'll see. I think I may have put it on that sheet yesterday, but.
1:33:44.931 --> 1:33:46.131
Brian Hyatt
That we shared internally.
1:33:50.141 --> 1:33:51.581
Basement
Not that one.
1:33:53.891 --> 1:33:54.11
Basement
The.
1:33:54.881 --> 1:34:0.441
Renzo Mogrovejo
I can share with you a safe link so you can you can see the credentials.
1:34:1.881 --> 1:34:2.321
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:34:7.681 --> 1:34:9.201
Luis Escobar
But yeah, that's that's huge.
1:34:9.201 --> 1:34:11.441
Luis Escobar
So that that's a lead magnet right there, right?
1:34:11.731 --> 1:34:15.211
Basement
No, no, that that was our biggest one.
1:34:15.211 --> 1:34:16.251
Basement
I mean, it was really.
1:34:18.211 --> 1:34:18.491
Basement
You know.
1:34:20.571 --> 1:34:26.891
Basement
And and we have all that information, if it was, if it was pulled over from suite CRM.
1:34:28.971 --> 1:34:41.51
Basement
No. Yeah. Suite. Yeah. Suite suite. CRM is where all the leads went over. If all the qualitative data about their dry skin, their.
1:34:41.701 --> 1:34:43.541
Basement
Their sex drive all that.
1:34:43.541 --> 1:34:47.981
Basement
I mean, that's all stuff that we we could use, I mean.
1:34:45.181 --> 1:34:45.381
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:34:47.801 --> 1:34:48.961
Luis Escobar
Great. Great.
1:34:47.911 --> 1:34:48.351
Brian Hyatt
Thank you.
1:34:49.521 --> 1:34:54.721
Luis Escobar
Yeah, let's definitely get our hands on that and just aggregate all this data.
1:35:8.511 --> 1:35:17.71
Luis Escobar
The other idea with the AI chat bots that whenever you're on the website, it's also gonna understand, you know your the the.
1:35:18.721 --> 1:35:30.721
Luis Escobar
His selections you made right on all these questions, so it'll be able to, you know, present you an offer or or a discount or or something that I know that you're interested in or relevant, you know upgrade.
1:35:23.731 --> 1:35:23.891
Brian Hyatt
Good.
1:35:34.11 --> 1:35:38.411
Luis Escobar
I really think that the, you know, the holidays are a really good opportunities.
1:35:35.521 --> 1:35:35.681
Brian Hyatt
Good.
1:35:38.411 --> 1:35:42.411
Luis Escobar
There's quite a few of them in a year. Count em, right?
1:35:42.931 --> 1:35:45.451
Luis Escobar
And then, you know, prepping for the holiday, right?
1:35:47.681 --> 1:35:49.201
Luis Escobar
What's the next one Labor Day?
1:35:52.471 --> 1:35:52.671
Luis Escobar
So.
1:35:52.641 --> 1:35:54.761
Basement
No July 4th.
1:35:55.811 --> 1:35:57.571
Luis Escobar
Right, right.
1:35:58.371 --> 1:36:8.651
Luis Escobar
Well, you know, a good, you know, 7 to 10 days prior to the holiday and then you can still milk it for another 4 to maybe even 10 more days after the holiday.
1:35:59.681 --> 1:35:59.841
Brian Hyatt
OK.
1:36:10.291 --> 1:36:10.691
Luis Escobar
Right.
1:36:12.451 --> 1:36:15.451
Luis Escobar
If we can get all you know the the marketing.
1:36:17.131 --> 1:36:18.411
Luis Escobar
Campaigns prepared well in advance.
1:36:20.371 --> 1:36:23.491
Luis Escobar
I don't know if you guys already have something planned for 4th of July.
1:36:23.461 --> 1:36:26.501
Basement
There should be a. There should be a holiday.
1:36:28.571 --> 1:36:31.131
Basement
Workflow that we've already spoken about.
1:36:29.511 --> 1:36:29.991
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:36:32.731 --> 1:36:32.851
Basement
But.
1:36:34.801 --> 1:36:36.761
Basement
Brian, do you know or?
1:36:36.501 --> 1:36:42.981
Brian Hyatt
Yes, there there is. And I know that Marissa has specifically for July 4th and July.
1:36:42.981 --> 1:36:45.741
Brian Hyatt
They're starting to work on that, so.
1:36:46.631 --> 1:36:47.591
Luis Escobar
Great. Great.
1:36:59.671 --> 1:37:5.151
Luis Escobar
And then Brian shared with me a few of the like local competitors, right?
1:37:7.411 --> 1:37:8.771
Luis Escobar
You can see my screen here.
1:37:11.111 --> 1:37:12.431
Luis Escobar
Thank you for Max.
1:37:14.571 --> 1:37:15.411
Luis Escobar
Gout aesthetic.
1:37:18.701 --> 1:37:27.541
Basement
I don't see all the competitors from like the surrounding. I mean I see a lot that we could add for sure.
1:37:19.431 --> 1:37:19.911
Brian Hyatt
Thank you.
1:37:28.691 --> 1:37:28.891
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:37:30.321 --> 1:37:32.401
Luis Escobar
Yeah, if there's not anymore, you can add.
1:37:32.401 --> 1:37:37.121
Luis Escobar
Please share that with me. But yeah. Is there any like like?
1:37:38.571 --> 1:37:41.51
Luis Escobar
Key ones that that really stand out that are like.
1:37:42.731 --> 1:37:43.491
Luis Escobar
They're they're local.
1:37:43.491 --> 1:37:45.571
Luis Escobar
They're not like life force, but they are.
1:37:46.901 --> 1:37:50.301
Basement
Yeah, yeah, yeah, none of those.
1:37:47.441 --> 1:37:47.561
Brian Hyatt
Yep.
1:37:50.381 --> 1:37:54.221
Basement
So I don't think any of the ones on the optimal health.
1:37:55.771 --> 1:37:59.211
Basement
Are a national brand, except for game game day.
1:37:59.411 --> 1:38:1.251
Basement
I know they have a lot.
1:38:3.811 --> 1:38:6.291
Basement
Optimized. Use a bigger one around here.
1:38:6.291 --> 1:38:7.771
Basement
A lot of people on that.
1:38:9.531 --> 1:38:10.171
Basement
On the optimal health.
1:38:14.331 --> 1:38:17.131
Basement
Yeah, marsials.
1:38:17.641 --> 1:38:21.401
Basement
Down in Lexington and they've expanded up here.
1:38:21.441 --> 1:38:26.721
Basement
So Marshall's lifestyle, medicine and find that.
1:38:30.401 --> 1:38:31.481
Luis Escobar
Gotcha. Gotcha.
1:38:34.91 --> 1:38:34.211
Basement
2.
1:38:44.811 --> 1:38:45.771
Basement
Someone starts with an R.
1:38:47.611 --> 1:38:50.611
Basement
What one starts with an R and then we'll write back graders.
1:38:52.51 --> 1:38:54.691
Basement
We'll revitalize that. That's.
1:38:55.841 --> 1:38:59.121
Basement
Maybe just one that might be worth putting on there, yeah.
1:39:0.981 --> 1:39:5.491
Luis Escobar
And so are are you guys getting a lot of bookings through through the system right now?
1:39:6.871 --> 1:39:16.751
Basement
I think recently we've seen a little bit of an uptick after working with our a person that's been optimizing the meta ads, but nothing sustainable.
1:39:17.151 --> 1:39:20.951
Basement
Yeah, I mean, I'd say like an average of like maybe one a day.
1:39:17.811 --> 1:39:18.171
Luis Escobar
All right.
1:39:22.451 --> 1:39:23.171
Basement
Through this?
1:39:22.601 --> 1:39:22.921
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:39:24.491 --> 1:39:24.971
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:39:26.561 --> 1:39:28.121
Basement
Yeah, we, we have a lot of.
1:39:30.1 --> 1:39:32.201
Basement
Capacity. Let's just put it like that so.
1:39:36.961 --> 1:39:42.1
Luis Escobar
Yeah, let's think about those like that, that bundle idea like, right?
1:39:42.401 --> 1:39:44.321
Luis Escobar
Nobody comes in just for one thing.
1:39:45.601 --> 1:39:45.721
Luis Escobar
Umm.
1:39:47.321 --> 1:39:49.481
Luis Escobar
Do you guys have like packages already like?
1:39:54.241 --> 1:39:59.241
Basement
There's like packages of like 3 micro needling injections or like 3.
1:39:59.201 --> 1:39:59.361
Brian Hyatt
OK.
1:40:0.691 --> 1:40:6.611
Basement
I think they did a it's not advertised well and the fact that you're asking looking through our products probably tells you enough.
1:40:6.611 --> 1:40:9.291
Basement
I don't think we do at least effectively.
1:40:8.691 --> 1:40:8.891
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:40:9.291 --> 1:40:12.451
Basement
Yeah, I mean right. So.
1:40:15.901 --> 1:40:17.221
Basement
But you're right though we.
1:40:16.171 --> 1:40:25.171
Luis Escobar
Is it just like trying to figure out the, you know, the the the whole cost profit ratio trying to make sure it makes sense?
1:40:28.231 --> 1:40:32.751
Luis Escobar
Or is it just trying to figure out which combination of products?
1:40:28.521 --> 1:40:30.681
Basement
Yeah. Well, no.
1:40:30.881 --> 1:40:45.401
Basement
I think it's more, yeah, just figuring out like a combination. I feel like that makes sense for people because so much on the aesthetic side is like personal choice. And like, you know, OK, your skin would be good for the.
1:40:45.401 --> 1:40:58.321
Basement
I don't know a lot. I feel like a lot of people don't get filler or do get injectables or like creating your own package. Almost like dragging and dropping the services to like your package and then it it'll add up like the savings at the bottom.
1:40:58.481 --> 1:41:0.681
Basement
As you're adding to it. Yeah, got it. Yeah.
1:41:2.51 --> 1:41:3.251
Luis Escobar
I'm loving that idea.
1:41:2.371 --> 1:41:14.291
Basement
Yeah. So, so, so along those lines, if we knew what their goals were and we knew what their conditions were, say, dry skin, I went fuller lips.
1:41:14.291 --> 1:41:15.931
Basement
I've got sagging cheeks.
1:41:17.891 --> 1:41:18.931
Basement
I feel bad.
1:41:18.931 --> 1:41:20.891
Basement
I mean, you know, we we could.
1:41:21.11 --> 1:41:24.691
Basement
We could custom design or propose a package.
1:41:26.811 --> 1:41:28.211
Basement
You know for for them.
1:41:28.601 --> 1:41:30.441
Basement
And that's what what we do.
1:41:31.971 --> 1:41:39.531
Basement
When when they come in, we see what? What they're. You know what what their goals are, right.
1:41:39.531 --> 1:41:45.411
Basement
I mean, so if they want to lose weight, they want fuller lips, they want yo yada, yada.
1:41:45.771 --> 1:41:55.211
Basement
I mean we we we certainly introduce them and talk about things that that that that that will help achieve those goals.
1:41:55.331 --> 1:41:58.411
Basement
I will also say one thing with the the packages especially.
1:41:58.681 --> 1:42:15.201
Basement
For aesthetic stuff is they've been like the aesthetic providers, especially a push back really hard at prepayments for some of this stuff because it's like really hard to estimate the amount that they'll need for like filler or for like the the different neurotoxins.
1:42:15.241 --> 1:42:23.561
Basement
It's like variable based off of everyone's different face like somebody might use one vial. Somebody might use two for the same service.
1:42:24.251 --> 1:42:25.691
Basement
So I don't know.
1:42:25.781 --> 1:42:25.901
Luis Escobar
MMM.
1:42:25.971 --> 1:42:33.971
Basement
Didn't want to get into a circumstance where people are, you know, either overpaying or underpaying and thinking that that was all their cost.
1:42:26.491 --> 1:42:26.571
Luis Escobar
Oh.
1:42:34.291 --> 1:42:37.771
Basement
So but but but in a sense you're right.
1:42:37.811 --> 1:42:51.491
Basement
I mean, like Hermosa's book talks about creating a package that nobody else can offer, or you know where where you you're not commodity, right? Like a Hydra facial.
1:42:52.261 --> 1:42:55.381
Basement
A unit of talks. All of those are things that you can shop around.
1:42:55.851 --> 1:43:6.451
Basement
Right. But if we created a package that included some intent, tangible type things you know?
1:43:8.821 --> 1:43:11.181
Basement
Then then you you can compare it.
1:43:12.301 --> 1:43:12.741
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:43:12.981 --> 1:43:17.221
Basement
And be able to brand something and make it uncom.
1:43:19.541 --> 1:43:21.61
Basement
Parable in the marketplace.
1:43:22.941 --> 1:43:25.421
Basement
It's certainly that designer feel.
1:43:25.691 --> 1:43:29.91
Basement
You know that unique experience?
1:43:30.781 --> 1:43:31.461
Basement
You know, so.
1:43:31.461 --> 1:43:32.901
Basement
So yeah, I mean I think.
1:43:34.491 --> 1:43:38.171
Basement
You know, and you, you'll get a higher margin too.
1:43:39.31 --> 1:43:40.351
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Yeah, no, I agree.
1:43:43.211 --> 1:43:50.171
Luis Escobar
This should also have like a a rewards program. After you spend 1000 bucks you get something.
1:43:51.941 --> 1:43:52.981
Luis Escobar
Or something like that.
1:43:56.681 --> 1:43:58.1
Basement
A lot of the specific.
1:43:59.531 --> 1:44:3.531
Basement
Product brands do have their own rewards.
1:44:6.221 --> 1:44:8.421
Basement
But, but that's not very well explained.
1:44:10.301 --> 1:44:12.541
Basement
And quite frankly, you're you're right.
1:44:13.701 --> 1:44:14.261
Basement
I I kind of hate.
1:44:20.261 --> 1:44:22.701
Basement
Promoting other brand names.
1:44:24.221 --> 1:44:27.21
Basement
When we should have our own, you know.
1:44:28.701 --> 1:44:28.941
Basement
Rewards.
1:44:29.571 --> 1:44:31.411
Basement
Type thing so.
1:44:32.721 --> 1:44:34.761
Luis Escobar
I get it for sure.
1:44:38.731 --> 1:44:44.971
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'm gonna continue my work and then we can reconvene tomorrow.
1:44:43.421 --> 1:44:43.581
Basement
OK.
1:44:49.281 --> 1:44:50.1
Luis Escobar
Let me see I got.
1:44:50.1 --> 1:44:51.561
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I got everything I need for now.
1:44:53.811 --> 1:44:59.411
Luis Escobar
Oh, one thing I wanted to ask, do you is there any recordings of the in person visit?
1:45:1.471 --> 1:45:2.911
Luis Escobar
Like from start to finish.
1:45:4.711 --> 1:45:9.311
Basement
The in person ones? No, not start to finish or no.
1:45:7.361 --> 1:45:7.561
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:45:10.211 --> 1:45:11.531
Luis Escobar
'Cause basically like.
1:45:13.61 --> 1:45:17.141
Luis Escobar
If if we can replicate, you know, all those questions, all that you know.
1:45:18.861 --> 1:45:22.221
Luis Escobar
User experience that that people are are experiencing in the office, right?
1:45:22.221 --> 1:45:27.61
Luis Escobar
We'll get an idea of what those questions should be or shouldn't be, or how to ask them.
1:45:27.761 --> 1:45:28.641
Luis Escobar
Went to Aston.
1:45:30.501 --> 1:45:34.341
Luis Escobar
It could influence the way we we present those those questions on the website, right?
1:45:35.951 --> 1:45:43.271
Basement
Have you been given and look, this is a very it's old, but have you been given a final?
1:45:44.941 --> 1:45:52.221
Basement
Story kind of like like the output. Have we given him like a a good example of what our finished product is.
1:45:54.341 --> 1:46:4.221
Basement
You probably need to see that for sure because you know that is the work product, at least for for for now.
1:45:58.491 --> 1:45:58.691
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:46:5.141 --> 1:46:5.541
Basement
Of what?
1:46:5.541 --> 1:46:7.421
Basement
The health assessment is.
1:46:8.791 --> 1:46:11.71
Basement
Yeah. And I think it's.
1:46:11.71 --> 1:46:12.351
Basement
I don't know.
1:46:12.351 --> 1:46:30.301
Basement
It's really like the best kind of touch point we have with our customers in between appointments is like this, like big document that summarizes all their blood test levels and information that they put on their forms and makes different recommendations based off of their different their active proble.
1:46:30.791 --> 1:46:32.431
Basement
Or symptoms of family history.
1:46:34.181 --> 1:46:36.261
Basement
And black walks through like what?
1:46:36.261 --> 1:46:39.541
Basement
Their how they compare to the optimal range is.
1:46:39.971 --> 1:46:44.11
Basement
And like, what symptoms could be caused by that supposed to?
1:46:40.791 --> 1:46:40.991
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:46:44.51 --> 1:46:56.171
Basement
And we can we can put all these rules and share it with some kind of like AI mean, you know, where where it could really be super.
1:46:56.291 --> 1:47:2.171
Basement
I'm starting to really think about how we like, like, wanna read kind of reorganize this.
1:46:56.711 --> 1:46:56.911
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:47:2.171 --> 1:47:4.771
Basement
I mean, it's like almost to the point where it's not.
1:47:5.501 --> 1:47:8.941
Basement
I guess not as much worth trying to figure out how it's built and updating it.
1:47:9.371 --> 1:47:14.171
Basement
More so, just like take the useful parts out that we like and then rebuild it around.
1:47:14.811 --> 1:47:32.781
Basement
So whether that's in Tableau or somewhere else or just just just just making sure that the rules are are correct, you know, I mean what what the optimal values are or are not and do they fall in line with you mean sharing all the rules based that that?
1:47:23.391 --> 1:47:23.591
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:47:32.781 --> 1:47:34.531
Basement
You already have, right? Yes, for sure.
1:47:34.531 --> 1:47:35.131
Basement
For sure.
1:47:35.331 --> 1:47:39.371
Basement
I just mean in terms of like adding on or maintaining.
1:47:39.451 --> 1:47:45.731
Basement
And updating it like I think, just the way that it's set up right now, there's almost surely better ways to be doing this.
1:47:45.731 --> 1:47:51.811
Basement
And like I don't know the changes that you've wanted me to make or taking like so much longer than what they should.
1:47:51.811 --> 1:47:53.11
Basement
You know, like what?
1:47:53.11 --> 1:47:56.651
Basement
I'm sure like a a current system would be capable of, you know, of doing.
1:47:56.791 --> 1:47:57.271
Luis Escobar
No.
1:47:58.61 --> 1:47:59.341
Basement
So just basically modifying like.
1:48:1.21 --> 1:48:7.661
Basement
The related tables, the custom tables on the database side and making sure all the IDs match basically.
1:48:8.761 --> 1:48:9.161
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
1:48:9.781 --> 1:48:9.941
Basement
But.
1:48:10.211 --> 1:48:13.91
Basement
I'm sure that there's like an easier way to do this. Where?
1:48:14.11 --> 1:48:22.611
Basement
We could have just drop downs with options so that Ted could go and do it instead of having to write SQL queries or whatever.
1:48:17.471 --> 1:48:18.71
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:48:23.171 --> 1:48:23.971
Luis Escobar
No, for sure.
1:48:24.51 --> 1:48:29.691
Luis Escobar
I think that's that's we can have a a deep type meeting just on this, right?
1:48:30.411 --> 1:48:37.331
Luis Escobar
You know it's we just need to figure out the right template, the right approach to figure out one time and then we can duplicate that, right?
1:48:38.821 --> 1:48:41.301
Luis Escobar
As long as we have a really strong and stable foundation.
1:48:44.461 --> 1:48:46.381
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'm. I'm on the same page on that.
1:48:48.111 --> 1:49:3.141
Basement
And another thing that like I've kind of thought that like we may want to switch away from. We're currently like doing all of our forms through open dental like which is I guess the idea is to have it in the same place to the charts and because their.
1:49:3.141 --> 1:49:12.911
Basement
Story is pulling from all these tables and open dental open dental database, but it's it's a terrible way to create forms like it's just.
1:49:13.741 --> 1:49:17.181
Basement
So like you have to go and set create each check box set.
1:49:17.651 --> 1:49:34.341
Basement
Set it to a reportable field in the database. You know, like each static box like it's impossible for like. I don't know, it's a full time job basically creating and updating forms. I feel like if we were if we were to do that through open data also I.
1:49:21.431 --> 1:49:21.551
Luis Escobar
No.
1:49:30.41 --> 1:49:30.201
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:49:34.341 --> 1:49:34.531
Basement
Don't know.
1:49:34.531 --> 1:49:42.531
Basement
At some point, thinking about yeah, the user doing itself journey, the user's journey should be much.
1:49:43.701 --> 1:49:44.141
Basement
Better, I mean.
1:49:44.701 --> 1:49:45.381
Luis Escobar
For sure.
1:49:45.381 --> 1:49:45.661
Luis Escobar
For sure.
1:49:46.501 --> 1:49:46.741
Basement
Yeah.
1:49:48.131 --> 1:50:6.261
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we're going to streamline that. Think, yeah, eventually we're going to have our own, just proprietary, you know, system that that's making the best of of you know the data that makes sense that it's actually beneficial. And I'm sure there's a lot of data that also doesn't really.
1:49:48.321 --> 1:49:48.681
Basement
Yeah.
1:50:6.291 --> 1:50:9.651
Luis Escobar
Help us. And so we we wanna like declutter.
1:50:9.651 --> 1:50:12.131
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that's the other thing with the AI. Right? Like we wanna.
1:50:13.21 --> 1:50:19.21
Luis Escobar
Like, really be like very specific with the instructions we're giving it, right.
1:50:19.531 --> 1:50:20.91
Luis Escobar
And and.
1:50:21.931 --> 1:50:26.451
Luis Escobar
The kind of data that's in the knowledge base should be highly relevant, right?
1:50:27.941 --> 1:50:29.461
Luis Escobar
It would just hallucinate, right?
1:50:45.571 --> 1:50:45.691
Luis Escobar
Umm.
1:50:52.211 --> 1:50:59.851
Luis Escobar
Yeah, there's a there's a. There's a few more services we're gonna have to also sign up to, right? But not immediate. Will probably end the next day or two.
1:50:59.851 --> 1:51:4.411
Luis Escobar
And I can just share that with you as well. Ted and Trent, I can handle that on the next meeting.
1:51:10.421 --> 1:51:15.301
Renzo Mogrovejo
One additional thing I would like to to check with you Luis is.
1:51:17.61 --> 1:51:18.101
Renzo Mogrovejo
If it's OK.
1:51:18.701 --> 1:51:21.861
Renzo Mogrovejo
If we keep using hot spot payments.
1:51:23.581 --> 1:51:36.381
Renzo Mogrovejo
Or we start using a stripe because we want to save the credit card without doing any charge and we can do that with HubSpot payments.
1:51:31.1 --> 1:51:31.601
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:51:36.901 --> 1:51:38.981
Renzo Mogrovejo
Maybe there is a workaround?
1:51:40.411 --> 1:51:40.771
Luis Escobar
Wait.
1:51:41.331 --> 1:51:48.611
Renzo Mogrovejo
We charge a $1.00 and then make a refund, but it it is not recommendable, right?
1:51:49.911 --> 1:51:52.791
Luis Escobar
I don't like it either that HubSpot causes us to do that.
1:51:50.61 --> 1:51:50.261
Renzo Mogrovejo
But.
1:51:54.31 --> 1:51:54.471
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yeah.
1:51:54.581 --> 1:51:56.701
Luis Escobar
Have that conflict with another project and.
1:51:58.941 --> 1:52:7.421
Luis Escobar
I you know, I like the idea that, you know, Housewa also has the plate options so people can pay with their bank account and just connect their ACH.
1:52:9.501 --> 1:52:10.861
Luis Escobar
That's really great also.
1:52:11.771 --> 1:52:11.971
Renzo Mogrovejo
Mm hmm.
1:52:13.621 --> 1:52:26.861
Luis Escobar
I encourage my customers to like, you know, my clients to give their customers a discount if they pay with ACH just because it's it's a more guaranteed payment. You know, you can't really do chargebacks on ACH.
1:52:29.991 --> 1:52:30.591
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yeah.
1:52:30.701 --> 1:52:34.181
Luis Escobar
Actually the Holy Grail is Apple Pay, right?
1:52:34.461 --> 1:52:37.941
Luis Escobar
The only way we can achieve Apple Pay is with right now is with Stripe.
1:52:38.551 --> 1:52:39.391
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yes.
1:52:39.511 --> 1:52:39.991
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:52:41.631 --> 1:52:44.711
Luis Escobar
So yeah, I think we should. I think we should sign up to Stripe.
1:52:41.891 --> 1:52:42.451
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yes, yes.
1:52:46.731 --> 1:52:49.51
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yeah, we we have an account.
1:52:49.411 --> 1:52:52.531
Renzo Mogrovejo
We I don't know if we are using that account to.
1:52:50.221 --> 1:52:50.381
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:52:53.581 --> 1:52:58.21
Renzo Mogrovejo
For in your payments, but we were using that for tripones.
1:52:59.421 --> 1:53:0.181
Basement
Yeah. OK.
1:53:0.181 --> 1:53:6.141
Basement
So that I've allowed that to be suspended only because.
1:53:5.291 --> 1:53:5.611
Renzo Mogrovejo
OK.
1:53:8.781 --> 1:53:14.21
Basement
Well, we we would just have to respond back to them and disconnect.
1:53:14.301 --> 1:53:17.181
Basement
Try tripods because.
1:53:18.711 --> 1:53:25.351
Basement
Right, right. Right now it's showing that we're selling meds online, which is in a strict.
1:53:26.751 --> 1:53:30.831
Basement
Violation. So we we we can move the account.
1:53:32.671 --> 1:53:37.351
Basement
And and certify that we're no no longer selling selling meds.
1:53:39.671 --> 1:53:40.351
Basement
Would it?
1:53:40.431 --> 1:53:43.271
Basement
Would it conflict with any of the aesthetic that like like?
1:53:46.381 --> 1:53:46.741
Basement
No.
1:53:58.411 --> 1:53:59.51
Basement
I do have to go.
1:53:58.491 --> 1:54:2.11
Luis Escobar
Did did HubSpot give you a hard time to get approved?
1:54:3.711 --> 1:54:7.191
Basement
It it I was doing it directly through Stripe.
1:54:7.191 --> 1:54:15.151
Basement
My, my, my communication, my communication was directly with Stripe.
1:54:7.731 --> 1:54:9.971
Luis Escobar
Who strad. OK.
1:54:15.691 --> 1:54:17.91
Luis Escobar
I have an account manager side.
1:54:17.91 --> 1:54:20.691
Luis Escobar
I'm. I'm gonna give him a ping and and see what he can tell me about.
1:54:22.351 --> 1:54:27.471
Luis Escobar
The the medical side of things, I know, I know there are some restrictions there.
1:54:28.91 --> 1:54:31.331
Basement
Yeah, but. But I do think that he'll tell you.
1:54:31.331 --> 1:54:42.891
Basement
She'll tell you that that there is that they do work with like a third party vendor that does manage the high risk.
1:54:38.941 --> 1:54:39.141
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:54:44.591 --> 1:54:46.191
Basement
Online sales of meds.
1:54:46.191 --> 1:54:48.991
Basement
So I think it's possible.
1:54:50.991 --> 1:54:51.591
Basement
But.
1:54:52.371 --> 1:54:57.851
Luis Escobar
But yeah, hopefully they support the Apple Pay because it will make a difference to the bottom line.
1:54:58.681 --> 1:55:5.681
Basement
But but but I think one of the things that they were trying to do though was you're trying to capture the card on file, right?
1:55:7.191 --> 1:55:9.991
Basement
But and Stripe won't allow you to do that.
1:55:11.631 --> 1:55:12.551
Basement
I thought I read that too.
1:55:13.711 --> 1:55:16.551
Basement
But Renzo, this thing just died.
1:55:16.141 --> 1:55:17.261
Luis Escobar
No you can.
1:55:17.301 --> 1:55:25.781
Luis Escobar
With Apple Pay, you can you can capture the initial payment and then it'll also do the renewal on that. If Apple Pay transaction.
1:55:26.561 --> 1:55:26.841
Basement
OK.
1:55:26.881 --> 1:55:27.881
Basement
It's a MasterCard.
1:55:28.491 --> 1:55:28.971
Luis Escobar
No.
1:55:28.641 --> 1:55:31.1
Basement
Your applic or what?
1:55:28.811 --> 1:55:36.811
Brian Hyatt
There I have the name of of the third party that hams and hers uses.
1:55:29.161 --> 1:55:29.321
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yeah.
1:55:31.1 --> 1:55:33.201
Basement
Whatever card you have a file here.
1:55:36.811 --> 1:55:39.111
Brian Hyatt
I have that written down, so I'll share that with you all.
1:55:40.141 --> 1:55:40.661
Luis Escobar
Perfect.
1:55:40.251 --> 1:55:40.491
Basement
OK.
1:55:41.941 --> 1:55:48.261
Luis Escobar
Yeah, let's, let's get that ball rolling and then hopefully we get approved by the time the sites live.
1:55:50.801 --> 1:55:54.41
Luis Escobar
But yeah, I'll let you go. Ted, I know you gotta go.
1:55:54.81 --> 1:55:55.241
Luis Escobar
I also have to go.
1:55:55.241 --> 1:55:57.201
Luis Escobar
But yeah, we'll we'll reconnect.
1:56:1.21 --> 1:56:2.981
Basement
Perfect. And you can always hit me up for anything you need.
1:56:2.981 --> 1:56:4.901
Basement
I work 24/7 so.
1:56:5.921 --> 1:56:7.201
Luis Escobar
Awesome. Awesome. Right on.
1:56:8.471 --> 1:56:10.231
Basement
Guys, thank you very very much.
1:56:8.671 --> 1:56:9.311
Luis Escobar
Thank you guys.
1:56:10.511 --> 1:56:11.431
Basement
Thank you.
1:56:11.591 --> 1:56:12.511
Brian Hyatt
Thank you.
1:56:13.231 --> 1:56:13.551
Luis Escobar
Bye now.
1:56:14.441 --> 1:56:14.801
Ximena Livia
Thank you.
1:56:14.861 --> 1:56:14.981
Basement
Bye.
1:56:15.221 --> 1:56:16.701
Renzo Mogrovejo
Thank you, guys. See you tomorrow.
1:56:17.141 --> 1:56:18.421
Basement
Bye bye Siri, look up.
