0:0:8.528 --> 0:0:8.768
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
0:0:16.968 --> 0:0:17.8
Ted Ennenbach
Uh.
0:0:17.48 --> 0:0:17.328
Ted Ennenbach
Yes.
0:3:30.168 --> 0:3:30.288
Ted Ennenbach
But.
0:3:48.8 --> 0:3:49.648
Luis Escobar
Hey, what's up, Ted?
0:3:52.208 --> 0:3:52.528
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
0:4:3.648 --> 0:4:3.768
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
0:4:6.48 --> 0:4:8.928
Ted Ennenbach
Hey, I'll be right there, OK?
0:4:8.448 --> 0:4:10.408
Luis Escobar
Yeah, take your time. All good.
0:5:17.128 --> 0:5:19.808
Ted Ennenbach
OK, so how did your meeting go with?
0:5:25.328 --> 0:5:27.168
Ted Ennenbach
Mr. Cliff.
0:5:27.808 --> 0:5:45.248
Luis Escobar
So the meeting went pretty good. I mean All in all. However, I mean you know, I think the strongest value that that that we can get from Cliff is, is in terms of like the storytelling and and the.
0:5:31.888 --> 0:5:32.208
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
0:5:45.568 --> 0:6:4.728
Luis Escobar
Copywriting specifically. I wanted to, you know, get his take on copywriting because I really do feel like copywriting is is a really huge factor in making these campaigns work. I mean, I've been part of some pretty, you know, successful campaigns. I did a couple of 6 figures in a short time frame.
0:6:5.168 --> 0:6:11.928
Luis Escobar
For weeks even. And I the thing they all have in common is just like really strong copywriting, yeah.
0:6:14.368 --> 0:6:21.608
Ted Ennenbach
When you say copywriting and you say campaigns, we're specifically talking about the web website, right? And.
0:6:20.608 --> 0:6:34.8
Luis Escobar
No, yes and no. I'm talking about the all the words, the words that are written, the words that are spoken on the videos and the scripts and and the words in in the captions of the social media.
0:6:35.408 --> 0:6:37.688
Luis Escobar
all the copywriting. Right?
0:6:38.168 --> 0:6:39.88
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah.
0:6:41.208 --> 0:6:50.808
Ted Ennenbach
So from a design aspect, like the shading, the colors, you don't feel as comfortable with that or what?
0:6:51.488 --> 0:7:7.128
Luis Escobar
I I do think he'll provide great value there too, but I also think like and I think he agrees too that like it's it's it's going to come alive when we really pick out those videos right and add a few of those images of like you know, industry related.
0:7:7.328 --> 0:7:23.328
Luis Escobar
Right. All in all, the the the theme that we're using is a is a really, you know, well structured theme that allows us to move things very easily, right. I can just show you an example, but once we, you know.
0:7:23.608 --> 0:7:40.928
Luis Escobar
Have the first storyline nailed. It's gonna be very easy to replicate the rest, right? And that's where him and I agree that like, you know, he he's, he's gonna write to you, but basically he thinks that like, you know, he can assist with building out this main storyline essentially.
0:7:41.8 --> 0:7:41.728
Luis Escobar
And.
0:7:43.88 --> 0:8:0.208
Luis Escobar
What we really mean by that is like the the the story of I was telling him how we really need that multiple stories. We need, you know, when you click on the aesthetics page from the very top to the bottom, you know it's taking you through a story right that that really resonates with someone.
0:7:43.608 --> 0:7:43.888
Ted Ennenbach
Yes.
0:8:0.408 --> 0:8:19.448
Luis Escobar
You know, interested in on the on the aesthetic side of things and then when you click on you know men, it's also you know from top to bottom. It's another story. You know are these stories similar in framework? Yes, right. And and then of course the home page story where which basically should encapsulate.
0:8:11.88 --> 0:8:11.248
Ted Ennenbach
Just.
0:8:20.48 --> 0:8:36.248
Luis Escobar
You know, the overarching message, which is men, women, you know, a new life for men and women utilizing, you know, advanced medicine and and advanced aesthetics or modern aesthetics, you know.
0:8:36.768 --> 0:8:47.768
Luis Escobar
These are the things that I think help us differentiate us from my life force, which we were also talking about for quite a bit, you know, and I was telling him, you know how, how.
0:8:48.888 --> 0:9:3.408
Luis Escobar
You know a new life kind of like my idea behind it was just cause like life force is really a strong brand in terms of like it it clearly sounds like what it does and and.
0:9:4.688 --> 0:9:24.88
Luis Escobar
It's it's an easy pitch. When you look at the website, it all makes perfect sense that we're speaking about life course, even though it's kind of like a odd word. People don't really go around saying life course. You get it, you immediately get it. And when you look at this website, yeah, it's nothing really special. It's just, you know, we just got to spend.
0:9:16.848 --> 0:9:17.8
Ted Ennenbach
Right.
0:9:18.128 --> 0:9:18.608
Ted Ennenbach
Mhm.
0:9:24.408 --> 0:9:27.688
Luis Escobar
30 minutes and find some good videos, honestly.
0:9:27.448 --> 0:9:34.208
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, I I love the idea of.
0:9:29.88 --> 0:9:29.128
Luis Escobar
Oh.
0:9:35.528 --> 0:9:52.768
Ted Ennenbach
Like when you say telling a story and you're so like the brand itself has its own story, right? And so that that story needs to be told. It can be told one of two ways, either by the founders or the.
0:9:38.448 --> 0:9:38.968
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:9:50.128 --> 0:9:50.488
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:9:53.808 --> 0:10:7.768
Ted Ennenbach
Providers or it can be told by the people that it serves, right? I mean kind of one of two ways or or both honestly. So, so, so, so, so, so we really have to to define.
0:9:58.888 --> 0:9:59.368
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:10:1.848 --> 0:10:2.648
Luis Escobar
No.
0:10:9.328 --> 0:10:18.648
Ted Ennenbach
Who and how we're going to tell that story, whether that's in a cinematic 90 second long form, 30 seconds shorter.
0:10:18.688 --> 0:10:20.528
Ted Ennenbach
30 seconds shorter.
0:10:21.408 --> 0:10:30.688
Ted Ennenbach
Exciting flash type form, really upbeat kind of thing. What you How are we doing that?
0:10:31.808 --> 0:10:51.408
Ted Ennenbach
But but but but before I do that, I mean I guess I'm just really trying to get get an understanding of how you see the web website flowing like like like what's the user journey is it that's the that's kind of the mapping that I.
0:10:46.928 --> 0:10:47.448
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:10:51.408 --> 0:10:52.888
Ted Ennenbach
I'd love to understand.
0:10:53.168 --> 0:11:3.928
Luis Escobar
The the overarching. So there's multiple. The way I see it is that you know we have multiple entry points right into our ecosystem, this one being.
0:11:1.888 --> 0:11:9.488
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, so, so like, that's like, like the hair, ED, weight, weight, weight loss, that kind of thing.
0:11:9.808 --> 0:11:24.728
Luis Escobar
Those are our different entry points, right? Our lead magnets, right? This is our primary lead magnet, which is our simple registration flow. We're not really asking for too many questions. At the very most, we're just asking you what your goals are.
0:11:12.248 --> 0:11:14.328
Ted Ennenbach
OK, OK, OK.
0:11:21.288 --> 0:11:21.568
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:11:25.248 --> 0:11:29.208
Ted Ennenbach
And then what? What's the end result of these?
0:11:25.768 --> 0:11:26.168
Luis Escobar
Right. Um.
0:11:31.488 --> 0:11:42.248
Ted Ennenbach
Magnets. Do you want it to be a score or like an age or like a like a, you know, this is where you're at now. This is how we can help you.
0:11:43.248 --> 0:11:58.408
Luis Escobar
That's exactly where we're going. Yeah. You know, the the initial, you know, 1.0 version that that that we're gonna get, you know, very soon, it's just gonna be a simple, you know, calculation giving you a number, right?
0:11:58.688 --> 0:12:13.408
Luis Escobar
But this needs to evolve, right? To really diving into like, you know, this is going to keep evolving, right? How? How can we just keep adding more value to someone who says they want to improve their mood, right?
0:12:4.488 --> 0:12:4.568
Ted Ennenbach
You.
0:12:11.568 --> 0:12:28.248
Ted Ennenbach
So what's what's interesting is life force breaks it down to you know those 12345678 things. Longevity, vitality.
0:12:14.488 --> 0:12:14.648
Luis Escobar
The.
0:12:19.768 --> 0:12:19.888
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:12:28.728 --> 0:12:33.128
Ted Ennenbach
Sexual health, hormones, weight loss, cardiac strength and brain.
0:12:33.288 --> 0:12:33.848
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:12:35.168 --> 0:12:35.528
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:12:35.768 --> 0:12:50.8
Ted Ennenbach
And and then if you expand, I don't know where that's at on the home site, but it's somewhere there. Well, I thought, yeah, yeah, so, so here if you expand one.
0:12:44.408 --> 0:12:44.728
Luis Escobar
Mm.
0:12:47.208 --> 0:12:47.448
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:12:51.608 --> 0:12:53.848
Ted Ennenbach
You know, yeah, so those symptoms.
0:12:55.88 --> 0:13:1.928
Ted Ennenbach
Those symptoms, similar symptoms can all be found in different ways. They're asking the same thing.
0:13:3.488 --> 0:13:18.768
Ted Ennenbach
That you know, you could almost give them a life score or in a new score based on how they because like all those same biomarkers are the same exact things that we're going to test as well.
0:13:18.768 --> 0:13:29.968
Ted Ennenbach
So not not only could you do the Ed, the hair, the weight loss, the energy, those things you could actually.
0:13:18.968 --> 0:13:19.528
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:13:31.8 --> 0:13:41.928
Ted Ennenbach
Give them a really good take on on where they score based on these eight different things and how what symptoms they say that they have.
0:13:44.328 --> 0:13:58.448
Ted Ennenbach
So, so, so, so what I'm saying is like, like we can give them a preview of what they're likely gonna be of we we could, we could say, hey, we can pre predict.
0:13:44.728 --> 0:13:45.288
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:13:52.488 --> 0:13:53.128
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:13:59.408 --> 0:14:18.688
Ted Ennenbach
Within a pretty close measure, if you're having these symptoms, you're low on these biomarkers. So, so, so, so if you're having low energy reduced whatever, you're low on testosterone period. I mean we, we, I mean we can almost guarantee it so, so.
0:14:7.568 --> 0:14:7.928
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:14:20.8 --> 0:14:35.488
Ted Ennenbach
So what I'm saying is we could have them fill out a similar magnet where they mark these things and we could give them a, we could give them a score based on.
0:14:26.608 --> 0:14:27.608
Luis Escobar
Mhm, mhm.
0:14:30.248 --> 0:14:30.568
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:14:35.568 --> 0:14:39.368
Ted Ennenbach
Brain vitality, whatever. It literally just.
0:14:40.928 --> 0:14:50.488
Ted Ennenbach
You know, do just that. Give them a preview to their health story.
0:15:1.808 --> 0:15:1.968
Ted Ennenbach
Cool.
0:15:2.8 --> 0:15:2.248
Luis Escobar
Um.
0:15:4.848 --> 0:15:21.728
Luis Escobar
What we have right now is actually the beginning of it, right? As as soon as somebody, you know, gets their username and password on a newlife.com, right, they get a user profile, right? And you see right here, we're already starting to build their profile.
0:15:22.168 --> 0:15:35.688
Luis Escobar
Or or collecting their date of birth, their gender. And then here's that welcome assessment, right? What are your health goals? So these will all be checked marked based on their selections and if somebody.
0:15:26.88 --> 0:15:26.368
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:15:34.728 --> 0:15:37.728
Ted Ennenbach
But then you get their symptoms too, right? I mean.
0:15:39.128 --> 0:15:53.608
Luis Escobar
At that I mean we we we also want to you know be good marketers and and we the name of the game is get as many emails and phone numbers as quickly as possible, right. This is just one of the seven ways we're going to be doing that.
0:15:48.168 --> 0:15:49.168
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:15:54.648 --> 0:15:55.528
Luis Escobar
Or or 17 blades.
0:15:55.128 --> 0:16:10.288
Ted Ennenbach
I'm just saying what what what what was so impactful is somebody saying like like like we we we we we would say on our old site take this hormone quiz.
0:16:10.568 --> 0:16:11.88
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:16:12.288 --> 0:16:21.528
Ted Ennenbach
And and and we will tell you if you're, you know, good.
0:16:23.8 --> 0:16:38.448
Ted Ennenbach
Probably low or you're likely low. Based on the answers that you give us, we can basically write a pool plan of care. So, so be like, so, so, so give us your information, give us your information and we'll send you the.
0:16:32.688 --> 0:16:33.168
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:16:40.168 --> 0:16:55.408
Ted Ennenbach
Results. Therefore, they actually took the time. I mean, thousands and thousands of folks took, took, took this test because because it wasn't just saying what are your goals or whatever. It was saying we're we're going to tell you where you're low.
0:16:42.88 --> 0:16:42.248
Luis Escobar
M.
0:16:55.848 --> 0:17:15.528
Ted Ennenbach
Like right now, don't worry about going to get getting a test. We're going to say this is, but you know this is where you're likely. This is where you need help. Then you say that the next step is to confirm it, right? So, so, so, so you were giving them something of a.
0:17:15.888 --> 0:17:29.168
Ted Ennenbach
Tangible like, oh ****, OK, I mean, I'm 98% positive or whatever and I'm low in this, this and this. So, so, OK, that's something of value.
0:17:30.328 --> 0:17:41.248
Ted Ennenbach
I just want that that that that's all I'm saying. But I mean what life force kind of get gives us a key to to to to make it even more.
0:17:30.488 --> 0:17:31.608
Luis Escobar
Definitely.
0:17:44.408 --> 0:17:55.728
Ted Ennenbach
Maybe even better by by by asking them their symptoms and then we could correlate it to those hormones.
0:17:56.728 --> 0:17:58.48
Luis Escobar
Yeah, literally.
0:17:58.488 --> 0:18:18.168
Ted Ennenbach
I mean like like literally I mean like well like I could I could average weight, I could average weight each of these symptoms and and tie it to these hormones and a plan of care. So, so, so of course they're not going to know what their total T is, but they're going to know.
0:18:1.8 --> 0:18:1.168
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:18:18.248 --> 0:18:35.928
Ted Ennenbach
If they have fatigue, low energy, frequent illnesses and then we could correlate that to their longevity score, vitality score and we could give them a a look at where they score now and say, hey, you know you you tell us that you're.
0:18:36.128 --> 0:18:52.168
Ted Ennenbach
49 but but what we're seeing you're you know you're you're not doing so well. But the good news is, but the great news is, is that we can make you feel much better and we can lower that score to.
0:18:43.808 --> 0:18:44.728
Luis Escobar
I'm going to them.
0:18:52.528 --> 0:18:54.88
Ted Ennenbach
A possible whatever.
0:18:56.8 --> 0:18:58.608
Luis Escobar
I love that, yeah.
0:18:56.408 --> 0:19:12.208
Ted Ennenbach
So, so, so, so, so then the next steps are to confirm it with labs, right? I I mean that that to me is value like like like like right there is if I could you know because many of these symptoms.
0:19:14.168 --> 0:19:25.528
Ted Ennenbach
Are the same, right? I mean like longevity, you go in like chronic, I mean low, low, low energy I think is the same one, you know.
0:19:27.128 --> 0:19:45.168
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, I think you see that several places, right? Low energy, low, low, low energy. I mean, so so you, you, you, you, you would only ask it once, right? But but but it would score in both your longevity and vi vi vi vitality. So what whatever they.
0:19:30.648 --> 0:19:31.888
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:19:46.728 --> 0:20:3.688
Ted Ennenbach
If they say yes, I have low energy very often a five. Well, you know, so it'd be one to five, one being I never have it. Five, I always have it right. Whatever symptoms they.
0:20:3.688 --> 0:20:21.48
Ted Ennenbach
These are so, so it can be one to one or it can be one to many, right? So low, low energy at least relates to one to many, right? It it relates to longevity and vibe, vibe, vibe, vibe, vitality.
0:20:13.728 --> 0:20:15.888
Luis Escobar
For sure, for sure.
0:20:21.128 --> 0:20:36.728
Ted Ennenbach
So I mean you you could just go through it and have a 20 question or you'll mark the symptoms that you have and you'll get a longevity, vitality, but it is a score, heart, heart score, everything. This is your projected age.
0:20:37.488 --> 0:20:44.128
Ted Ennenbach
Right. I mean, I mean, how cool would would that be? We we we give them a a projected age.
0:20:45.728 --> 0:21:1.128
Luis Escobar
This is totally in line with like my philosophy on like good marketing, right? So it's you want to give pretty much 99% of of the value, right? And then just ask them to pay for that remaining 1%. And then I mean they're gonna.
0:21:1.368 --> 0:21:9.568
Luis Escobar
They're already so happy with all the value we just gave them, right? They're not even going to think about, you know, questioning whatever it is.
0:21:4.48 --> 0:21:5.488
Ted Ennenbach
Right, right.
0:21:8.488 --> 0:21:23.728
Ted Ennenbach
But I think if we can get their age up front, it's sort of like the lady that's reading the tarot cards on the corner. You know, she, she, she sees.
0:21:13.8 --> 0:21:13.768
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:21:21.728 --> 0:21:22.368
Luis Escobar
Right.
0:21:23.928 --> 0:21:41.728
Ted Ennenbach
A 30 year old walking up with a three-year-old girl, you know? Well, I see in your future, Minnie Slick was like, you know, like, come on, I mean, tell me something. I don't already know. So, so I mean, but I mean, we're going to do kind of the same thing, right?
0:21:41.848 --> 0:21:55.928
Ted Ennenbach
If we already know, know your age, and we know that you're marking these things, damn it. I mean, it's pretty easy to tie one and one together, you know, and we could come up with, we can come up with.
0:21:52.48 --> 0:21:52.728
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:21:56.648 --> 0:22:14.448
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, we could literally come up with a longevity, vitality. I mean, we could literally just use same words and come up with, I mean, even before life. I mean, why even go to life force? Because we're going to give you the value up front and just confirm it with serum levels on the back end.
0:22:1.208 --> 0:22:1.568
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:22:4.848 --> 0:22:5.408
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:22:15.568 --> 0:22:35.168
Luis Escobar
Exactly, exactly. Like literally just, I mean this is how we undermine them like in every way and aspect. Another differentiator is like life force doesn't have aesthetics and that works to our favour. I mean aesthetics are a part of like your well-being, right? Of course you know your the way you feel and.
0:22:27.848 --> 0:22:28.328
Ted Ennenbach
Mhm.
0:22:31.808 --> 0:22:31.968
Ted Ennenbach
Yep.
0:22:35.368 --> 0:22:45.688
Luis Escobar
The way your your health is, of course it's all very important, but also like just the way you look, it's it's not a non-zero, you know, it's not a zero factor.
0:22:43.928 --> 0:22:58.968
Ted Ennenbach
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not not at all. And in fact, even, I mean, you could even. Yeah. So, so I've got ideas on that too. But, but, but, but I mean, there's. Yes, yes.
0:22:47.728 --> 0:22:47.808
Luis Escobar
Oh.
0:22:54.328 --> 0:23:2.248
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Yeah. So it all plays into each other, right? The aesthetic marketing, the medical marketing, the the symptom marketing.
0:23:0.608 --> 0:23:11.688
Ted Ennenbach
But but I'm saying right right now though on our page we could say get, get your, get, get your.
0:23:13.168 --> 0:23:27.208
Ted Ennenbach
Biological age now. And then for them to go, oh ****, you know, yeah, I mean, say, say, say it comes back, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm forty-nine. It comes back that I'm forty-nine.
0:23:16.768 --> 0:23:17.368
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:23:28.928 --> 0:23:46.888
Ted Ennenbach
But I don't want to feel, you know, so you you you would say say, well, I don't want to feel 49, right? I mean, you know our goal is to make you feel 25, right? Which is why I still love the the name 25555 again, but but.
0:23:36.608 --> 0:23:37.88
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:23:46.88 --> 0:23:46.368
Luis Escobar
Correct.
0:23:47.128 --> 0:23:58.368
Ted Ennenbach
But I mean, but I mean our so, so, so, so, so like maybe that is bringing out your best is more specific. It's more like no, we are.
0:24:0.208 --> 0:24:19.608
Ted Ennenbach
We're going to, we're going to replenish the the youth both health and aesthetic wise as much as we possibly can and and that's that's different for different folks, right. I mean but but but I mean you know the goal would be for someone to look and feel as young as they possibly can.
0:24:19.688 --> 0:24:23.168
Luis Escobar
Totally. Totally. Yeah.
0:24:21.88 --> 0:24:21.848
Ted Ennenbach
And that's our goal.
0:24:22.648 --> 0:24:42.568
Ted Ennenbach
That's our goal. So, so I mean if we could somehow put these common symptoms into a weighted scoring, I can tell you, I can tell you for sure if they're vitamin D by by the way is a hormone and we and we and we we actually know what it does.
0:24:42.568 --> 0:24:58.888
Ted Ennenbach
So, so if you look at just the longevity markers here, I can say you're you're you're likely high or low in the C reactive protein vitamin D.
0:24:43.128 --> 0:24:43.648
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:25:9.968 --> 0:25:10.528
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:25:10.568 --> 0:25:11.568
Ted Ennenbach
That's playing.
0:25:11.528 --> 0:25:28.768
Luis Escobar
For sure. More than they knew before they, you know, clicked on the ad. Yeah, we just got to like, overwhelm them with a good amount of value. Like, you know, even though they were just seeking some insight, we just give them, you know, a bunch more like just step.
0:25:13.368 --> 0:25:13.568
Ted Ennenbach
3.
0:25:15.488 --> 0:25:19.168
Ted Ennenbach
Right, right. But but but.
0:25:28.368 --> 0:25:44.208
Ted Ennenbach
So get get get get your a new life score right now. Get get it right now. I mean get get a get a seven or eight page you know based on longevity, vitality, strength, whatever cardiac. I mean we could give them their score right now today.
0:25:37.8 --> 0:25:37.248
Luis Escobar
Hmm.
0:25:42.808 --> 0:25:58.688
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that's the other thing. So yeah, I wanna, I think we should, you know, run with the a new life score. That's the official like branding of the the official main score that that people pay for.
0:25:59.88 --> 0:26:14.848
Luis Escobar
So if you you come in the door for your free hair, hair score right now you know that your hair is a 7 out of 10, which you know usually correlates with your age, your hair age being, I don't know, 10 years.
0:26:16.8 --> 0:26:35.408
Luis Escobar
Older than it should be. You know, how would you like to find out your a new life score, your your comprehensive a new life score? Or if you're not interested in that, you can also just take the our free hormone assessment or take our free skin assessment so you can get your skin score and now you got your free hair score.
0:26:35.608 --> 0:26:51.568
Luis Escobar
You got your free skin score. Pretty pretty soon you're gonna acquire all of our free scores from all our different, you know, lead magnets. And I mean something's gonna convince you to obviously pay for the a new live score, right? The comprehensive 1 unless you just want.
0:26:50.768 --> 0:26:56.328
Ted Ennenbach
And the more and the the more quizzes they take, the more we know about them.
0:26:56.248 --> 0:27:11.768
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, correct. And so that's what I was just showing you here. And this is the actual like, you know, this is every member of our website will have these fields, right. So based on, you know, if they answered the skin assessment, what is your skin type?
0:27:12.328 --> 0:27:13.728
Luis Escobar
Oily and you know.
0:27:14.968 --> 0:27:28.728
Ted Ennenbach
So, so, so do do we, do we go ahead and create a long, long, longevity, vitality, sexual health, hormone, weight loss, cardiac strength and brain as well? I mean, do do we?
0:27:27.168 --> 0:27:27.408
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:27:29.608 --> 0:27:29.968
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:27:29.688 --> 0:27:35.448
Ted Ennenbach
I don't. I don't know that I want to have them all separate. Like I kind of want to tie these.
0:27:33.128 --> 0:27:49.208
Luis Escobar
Well, we don't have to. Some of these might make sense to just keep them together, right? But it also doesn't hurt and it doesn't take too much energy to also build out those. So if somebody just happens to, you know, land on our strength page and is really.
0:27:39.968 --> 0:27:40.88
Ted Ennenbach
Right.
0:27:49.408 --> 0:27:55.488
Luis Escobar
You know, wants to do a deep dive on his strength. We have a forum for you, I guess.
0:27:58.8 --> 0:28:9.248
Luis Escobar
We we want, you know, we can't pretend we know what's going to work right now. We need to throw a lot of things at the wall and see what sticks, right? We're going to find the.
0:28:7.448 --> 0:28:23.688
Ted Ennenbach
I do do know what what what did what did work in the past was like you said was like you said give them something of high value give them. They will give you more information the more high value you give them.
0:28:13.928 --> 0:28:14.568
Luis Escobar
Sure, sure.
0:28:19.128 --> 0:28:19.328
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:28:23.848 --> 0:28:29.808
Ted Ennenbach
So, so, so I don't think that that'll ever change though.
0:28:24.168 --> 0:28:26.768
Luis Escobar
For sure, for sure.
0:28:29.968 --> 0:28:46.888
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I agree. Depends. What I mean is like the set the the the angle that we're approaching it at, right. It's all the same spiel really. We're just coming at it from a skin angle or a hair angle or a hormone angle, right?
0:28:47.288 --> 0:28:50.328
Luis Escobar
You know, different people get triggered by different things.
0:28:48.328 --> 0:29:3.808
Ted Ennenbach
So what? What is the home page? So what? What is the home page look like then? Is it very similar to life force just with men and women up top? Men, women aesthetics up top? Yeah.
0:29:2.88 --> 0:29:4.88
Luis Escobar
Uh, yeah.
0:29:5.48 --> 0:29:10.48
Luis Escobar
I would say so. It would, you know, try to like encompass our.
0:29:6.8 --> 0:29:7.408
Ted Ennenbach
Think so.
0:29:10.888 --> 0:29:22.528
Luis Escobar
Our entire spectrum, right? Just we're we're about men, we're about women, we're about medicine, we're about aesthetics, we're we're about, you know, those are the four pillars for a new life.
0:29:23.568 --> 0:29:23.648
Luis Escobar
Oh.
0:29:24.648 --> 0:29:40.488
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, what? So what's the next step then? Like, what did Cliff say as far as timing? What? What? What? I mean, I just don't want to get stuck in some *******.
0:29:25.608 --> 0:29:25.888
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:29:37.688 --> 0:29:39.8
Luis Escobar
It it seems.
0:29:41.8 --> 0:29:47.968
Ted Ennenbach
You know, I want to have an option this year to where we don't have to.
0:29:47.328 --> 0:30:6.208
Luis Escobar
Yeah, no, I think, I think Cliff is a great guy and I think he he he can add a lot of value. He did say that he really doesn't know how much time he can commit to this. It seems like he has a lot of commitments right now. And so like the earliest he would even engage in like the early, you know, steps of this would be like next week.
0:30:6.488 --> 0:30:25.928
Luis Escobar
I I expressed to him that I'm I'm really trying to you know move the needle right now really fast. I mean we you know we're we're we're pretty much over a lot of the heavy lifting with the back end right. We can get you know some traction going ASAP and that's why I was actually.
0:30:26.168 --> 0:30:32.688
Luis Escobar
Making some moves last night with getting your stripe connected and running some tests there, making sure.
0:30:31.408 --> 0:30:43.888
Ted Ennenbach
So so OK so so yeah the the stripe is confusing because the the link link that I got was.
0:30:45.688 --> 0:30:47.8
Ted Ennenbach
Sorry.
0:30:47.288 --> 0:30:50.688
Luis Escobar
Yeah, if you want to share your screen, I can walk you through it.
0:30:52.848 --> 0:30:55.88
Ted Ennenbach
Well, it wasn't even.
0:31:1.128 --> 0:31:10.448
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, it just says join, join, join, join account. So so it's almost like did did did you create like?
0:31:6.248 --> 0:31:7.408
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:31:12.368 --> 0:31:13.888
Ted Ennenbach
A new one or?
0:31:13.768 --> 0:31:29.408
Luis Escobar
Yeah, so it's this is called, it's not Stripe, it's Woo Payments and it's basically a white label of Stripe, right? It's a WooCommerce direct integration with Stripe.
0:31:21.808 --> 0:31:22.48
Ted Ennenbach
What?
0:31:29.968 --> 0:31:30.48
Luis Escobar
Bye.
0:31:31.608 --> 0:31:39.48
Luis Escobar
There are some benefits to this, right? And especially when it comes to the in person payments.
0:31:31.728 --> 0:31:32.88
Ted Ennenbach
OK, uh.
0:31:40.888 --> 0:31:57.248
Ted Ennenbach
So oh so so but but I got a notification from Stripe so so so then do I do I have to lo lo lo log in and in my Stripe account and join it? Is that what what's going on?
0:31:46.488 --> 0:31:48.648
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, it'll it'll say that.
0:31:57.448 --> 0:32:14.48
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I I sent the invite to your Ted at enu.co e-mail. So yeah, if you just, you know, log in using that e-mail, it's probably gonna ask you to like verify some information.
0:32:11.848 --> 0:32:18.408
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, that's a pro problem. We didn't. When I set up that stripe, we didn't even have that.
0:32:19.848 --> 0:32:23.768
Ted Ennenbach
OK, so I just need to change that to what it actually is.
0:32:23.368 --> 0:32:30.328
Luis Escobar
You you can keep it as is though. I mean if if you can have two different Stripe accounts with different emails too if if that's.
0:32:31.408 --> 0:32:41.568
Ted Ennenbach
Well, I could, I could, but then don't I have to then get it FSA and HSA approved and I mean go through that whole thing?
0:32:31.848 --> 0:32:33.128
Luis Escobar
You know the case.
0:32:43.48 --> 0:32:58.608
Luis Escobar
I'm looking into this as well. There, you know there is not a direct FHA or FSA integration with Stripe, right? We're we're gonna have a separate service or solution for those situations.
0:32:58.408 --> 0:33:12.208
Ted Ennenbach
I believe that that the credit card processor, OK, yeah, I'm pretty sure that whether it's Stripe or somebody else, we are completely able to accept HSA and FSA cards.
0:32:59.568 --> 0:32:59.728
Luis Escobar
Right.
0:33:9.248 --> 0:33:9.728
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:33:13.568 --> 0:33:13.608
Ted Ennenbach
Uh.
0:33:14.248 --> 0:33:30.448
Luis Escobar
OK. Yeah, we can dial that Lynn. What I would say is just like we it's it's definitely good to have multiple processors, right. I some of the e-commerce sites I work with, we they'll have three, you know, just as backups.
0:33:16.88 --> 0:33:17.888
Ted Ennenbach
I I would just think.
0:33:28.888 --> 0:33:29.88
Ted Ennenbach
Yes.
0:33:30.568 --> 0:33:32.768
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
0:33:30.808 --> 0:33:50.128
Luis Escobar
So, so yeah, I also I was gonna suggest, you know, get get PayPal. PayPal is very convenient. People, you know, use it often and we should apply for that Klarna and after a firm as well. I I have a feeling there.
0:33:51.88 --> 0:33:55.408
Luis Escobar
There's a chance you you guys will get approved, you know.
0:33:53.488 --> 0:33:57.288
Ted Ennenbach
OK, so so so Stripe sent me a notification.
0:33:58.568 --> 0:34:11.88
Ted Ennenbach
Patient that you I guess set up so that I want to go through that joint joint account set up right? OK, I guess.
0:34:3.488 --> 0:34:4.8
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:34:8.848 --> 0:34:9.768
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:34:12.288 --> 0:34:25.488
Ted Ennenbach
OK, so I'll do do that. I guess it doesn't matter if if there's multiple stripe accounts all tying to the same checking account number.
0:34:23.848 --> 0:34:26.408
Luis Escobar
No, no, I I have like 6 accounts.
0:34:26.928 --> 0:34:27.248
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
0:34:30.8 --> 0:34:45.848
Ted Ennenbach
Good. All right. Well, what? What else needs to be done? I'm going to, I'm going to start working on kind of buzzwords, phrases.
0:34:46.248 --> 0:34:46.608
Ted Ennenbach
Brand.
0:34:48.888 --> 0:35:1.488
Ted Ennenbach
Qualities, that kind of things that maybe we could potentially throw into like a a like AI script writing for that 92nd, you know, type thing.
0:35:3.288 --> 0:35:3.328
Ted Ennenbach
Oh.
0:35:3.768 --> 0:35:16.488
Luis Escobar
Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, once we have like, you know, the the framework dialed in and we we let, we can just let AI really just help us put everything together.
0:35:16.528 --> 0:35:31.968
Ted Ennenbach
But but I will kind of go back to and not forget about. I really do like the idea of taking the symptoms that life force has and recreating a a new life score.
0:35:32.128 --> 0:35:32.208
Ted Ennenbach
Um.
0:35:34.288 --> 0:35:35.328
Ted Ennenbach
Is that what you're?
0:35:35.288 --> 0:35:39.168
Luis Escobar
As we were as we were speaking, I was just having AI run this.
0:35:37.448 --> 0:35:39.808
Ted Ennenbach
Sweet, sweet, sweet.
0:35:42.648 --> 0:35:57.568
Luis Escobar
Overlap, overlapping symptoms analysis. Low energy appears in longevity, vitality and hormones. Poor sleep appears in longevity, vitality, hormones and weight loss. Let me change this. I think this is everything we need.
0:35:45.288 --> 0:35:45.528
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:35:55.408 --> 0:36:0.888
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah. So I mean, look, you would just ask about that. I mean, you would literally just ask.
0:36:3.168 --> 0:36:7.728
Ted Ennenbach
Once those and then ask all the other ones and do.
0:36:8.528 --> 0:36:10.368
Ted Ennenbach
One to one, right?
0:36:10.248 --> 0:36:10.888
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:36:11.968 --> 0:36:14.968
Ted Ennenbach
Vitamin K Can you send me that please?
0:36:15.848 --> 0:36:17.608
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:36:19.568 --> 0:36:21.168
Ted Ennenbach
That's super ******* cool.
0:36:22.328 --> 0:36:23.568
Luis Escobar
Biomarker Simpson.
0:36:26.128 --> 0:36:28.448
Luis Escobar
National Library.
0:36:28.288 --> 0:36:35.288
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, we we don't need that. I'm more interested in just their, their.
0:36:36.768 --> 0:36:37.448
Ted Ennenbach
You know.
0:36:38.848 --> 0:36:41.968
Ted Ennenbach
I don't want to get too deep in the woods, but.
0:36:41.608 --> 0:36:56.48
Luis Escobar
Yeah, but yeah, no, I'm already making headway on, you know, this scoring system we're calling it, right? There's there's a scoring system involved at the basic assessment level.
0:36:48.488 --> 0:36:48.808
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:36:57.88 --> 0:37:3.528
Luis Escobar
Right, so I in HubSpot you're gonna see we have our we have a new object here called basic assessments.
0:37:5.48 --> 0:37:20.848
Luis Escobar
Right. So anytime somebody submits their hair assessment or their skin assessment or their health assessment or even if they just register on the website and tell us what their goal is, right, we're we're calling that a a basic assessment.
0:37:6.408 --> 0:37:6.888
Ted Ennenbach
Yes.
0:37:10.368 --> 0:37:10.808
Ted Ennenbach
Just.
0:37:22.208 --> 0:37:37.48
Luis Escobar
Right. And so one can have, you know, 1520 basic assessments on their profile, right? And they can do the same one over and over again and we can keep track of those changes and and and the the answers that they gave us.
0:37:37.488 --> 0:37:48.48
Luis Escobar
Right. But yeah, so we have a place for that, right? I I I've actually been having quite some fun on this plugin. It's on version.
0:37:49.888 --> 0:37:50.248
Luis Escobar
20.
0:37:55.928 --> 0:37:58.648
Ted Ennenbach
All right, so that not not to jump off.
0:37:57.168 --> 0:38:4.8
Luis Escobar
22.8 I've been going through all kinds of variations of this.
0:38:1.128 --> 0:38:1.368
Ted Ennenbach
Jesus.
0:38:4.8 --> 0:38:16.488
Ted Ennenbach
Jesus, not not to jump all over the place, but what? What? What was the end result of your conversation with Cliff? Like what he would get back?
0:38:9.128 --> 0:38:9.288
Luis Escobar
M.
0:38:15.288 --> 0:38:33.8
Luis Escobar
He's gonna write to you and yeah, give you a proposal on on basically how he can come in and offer his storytelling and and and design, you know, you know, consulting and advice on on all these pages and.
0:38:33.88 --> 0:38:52.48
Luis Escobar
You know, I see value in that, right. I also, you know, there's a lot that I feel like I strongly can do myself to, right. There's, you know, we've been, you know, on this, you know, limited agreement at the moment and I've been putting a lot of my energy, I feel like into the technical side of it, right.
0:38:52.128 --> 0:39:8.208
Luis Escobar
I feel like if I just dial in the design and if I also get some good advice from people like Cliff or and then your your team as well, right? Like I said, we just really got to figure out, you know, what those videos are and what those images are and this website really comes to life.
0:39:8.688 --> 0:39:24.168
Luis Escobar
I mean there's I would argue our website, you know from a web design feature standpoint and and it's it's more rich than my life course, right? What what what they got going for them is some pretty great images like these are very thoughtful.
0:39:26.128 --> 0:39:28.928
Luis Escobar
Lee selected videos and images.
0:39:30.168 --> 0:39:41.328
Luis Escobar
You know this, this right here, like when I think of, you know, health and medicine, the first or second thing I think about is scrubs, right? So this.
0:39:41.208 --> 0:39:49.848
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, and it's kind of the girl. It's the girl, girl, girl, girl next door type type thing, you know? So yeah.
0:39:42.368 --> 0:39:45.8
Luis Escobar
I'm not. I'm not even reading this, but I it just.
0:39:50.608 --> 0:39:58.688
Luis Escobar
And she's in scrubs. It's like, OK, I'm obviously on a professional medical website right now. Have scrubs. It must be.
0:39:53.168 --> 0:39:53.768
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:39:56.128 --> 0:40:11.768
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, so, So what? What? OK, So what what I really need, whether it's you or just Trent or me or somebody, we need to sign up with what life force because I need to know who are they using?
0:40:12.208 --> 0:40:30.968
Ted Ennenbach
Because I think our ability the the the one thing that limits our growth right now it is is is waiting on the patient or the visitor to go get labs and and I want to be able to say look no you could literally schedule a phlebotomist.
0:40:32.408 --> 0:40:48.208
Ted Ennenbach
You know, you know once you pay us or or even maybe we'll we'll give you the calendar and say look you know you kind of temporarily hold hold a time, but I mean they they feel like.
0:40:48.888 --> 0:40:53.608
Ted Ennenbach
They're literally scheduling the the next step at or when they pay.
0:40:54.648 --> 0:40:55.888
Luis Escobar
Mhm, mhm.
0:40:56.368 --> 0:41:10.328
Ted Ennenbach
That that that's the one one thing that I think Lifeforce is not good at is that it's it's very unclear. You know, like you pay and then what, right? I mean like I'm you're charging me $349, great.
0:41:11.808 --> 0:41:20.168
Ted Ennenbach
But how am I going to wait two weeks? Am I going to wait 24 hour? You know, when can I get in or when, when, when can somebody get out?
0:41:20.408 --> 0:41:28.488
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah. I I did some research on on some like providers. I think I shared that with you, right on.
0:41:27.888 --> 0:41:32.768
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Get labs and and yeah, I saw it.
0:41:37.648 --> 0:41:55.168
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah so I saw saw saw that but but but I'm I'm going to I mean we're we're gonna we we need to know who they're using cause I get the feeling that they're using somebody on a national.
0:41:56.568 --> 0:41:56.768
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:41:56.888 --> 0:41:57.888
Luis Escobar
You think so?
0:41:58.88 --> 0:41:58.768
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, I.
0:41:59.488 --> 0:42:3.248
Luis Escobar
You think? I feel like it's multiple sources.
0:42:3.368 --> 0:42:6.288
Ted Ennenbach
Maybe you're right. Maybe you're right.
0:42:6.528 --> 0:42:9.88
Luis Escobar
I mean, it's not.
0:42:10.728 --> 0:42:17.168
Luis Escobar
Some, you know, some some of these companies just specialize in certain regions, right? Midwest, etcetera.
0:42:18.568 --> 0:42:21.888
Luis Escobar
They don't want to like experiment with other regions.
0:42:24.8 --> 0:42:34.928
Luis Escobar
But yeah, let's do our due diligence. Yeah, I'll definitely put some time into this. Totally makes sense how, you know, it makes all the difference for sure. You want to, you know.
0:42:36.248 --> 0:42:37.728
Luis Escobar
Success loves speed.
0:42:37.448 --> 0:42:55.88
Ted Ennenbach
That's the one that that that's the hiccup that we have now is that we we, you know, we can't, we could get get them to pay us, but then we're just waiting on them. You know, we we we we really can't do anything else.
0:42:42.368 --> 0:42:42.968
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:42:55.688 --> 0:42:58.848
Ted Ennenbach
And So what what we want to be able to do is.
0:43:3.248 --> 0:43:21.808
Ted Ennenbach
Sorry what what what what we want to be able to do is just have have them book something that's convenient for them and then immediately say OK based on that if you do that then our our provider will be available to meet with you.
0:43:22.368 --> 0:43:28.648
Ted Ennenbach
Seven days after that or you know whenever the labs come back, so.
0:43:27.288 --> 0:43:28.808
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:43:29.768 --> 0:43:45.168
Luis Escobar
And there should also be like a, you know, like a a journey after that, like you sign up. I mean, I'd be surprised if there isn't with my life course, you know, I have that meeting tomorrow in the morning at 10 and then I'll be signed up probably during that meeting or afterwards.
0:43:40.608 --> 0:43:40.768
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
0:43:45.688 --> 0:43:56.88
Luis Escobar
But like, I'm guessing like day one I should receive an e-mail and a text with a certain message and then day two, day three, and then after I get my labs, you know.
0:43:56.408 --> 0:44:15.888
Ted Ennenbach
Right. Yeah. No, no, no. There there there needs to be like a podcast like like a you know hey you know this person came came in so excited to to to you know what what what what what's unpack his his issues and and based on what we know life force is going to be able to do all this.
0:43:57.328 --> 0:43:58.48
Luis Escobar
It's.
0:44:2.808 --> 0:44:3.288
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:44:16.8 --> 0:44:30.968
Ted Ennenbach
You know, yeah. So I mean, you're building up excitement and engagement all during the way. Gotta be so ******* cool for AI to customize.
0:44:25.528 --> 0:44:26.688
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:44:31.88 --> 0:44:33.488
Ted Ennenbach
All of these experiences.
0:44:36.8 --> 0:44:49.808
Luis Escobar
This is exciting, but I got. I mean, I'm thinking a lot about how we can do all this for sure. And I mean, it's within reach. You you saw how easily I just, you know, asked AI to help us, right? We got some pretty good answers.
0:44:49.328 --> 0:45:6.8
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, but, but, but, but, but can we automate that? You know, I mean that's the that that's the thing. Can you automate when they click this, this is immediately created or whatever, you know, it'd be cool to, I mean.
0:44:53.128 --> 0:44:54.848
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:45:5.808 --> 0:45:6.48
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:45:7.248 --> 0:45:24.88
Ted Ennenbach
It'd be cool to basically just not even have to use Tab, Tab, Tab, Tab, Tableau for this wonky looking story that we have, you know, and for a I to create.
0:45:24.408 --> 0:45:29.448
Ted Ennenbach
Some amazing video presentation that both the.
0:45:31.888 --> 0:45:46.688
Ted Ennenbach
Provider and the patient watches, you know, so it's it's a consistent message, a consistent theme and then the provider basically you know they they would have already approved.
0:45:36.568 --> 0:45:37.688
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:45:47.88 --> 0:46:3.208
Ted Ennenbach
All the scripts and everything you know whatever and and the provider would would say hey what did I miss you know what what what else is there kind kind of thing. So that that's the future row that's that's the *******.
0:46:3.288 --> 0:46:4.528
Ted Ennenbach
****, so.
0:46:4.408 --> 0:46:24.48
Luis Escobar
I can see that. I can see that, man. No, I think we're we're putting together the right foundation on this. Just like setting up our HubSpot properly and our website properly and getting the story, you know, down properly. That's what's gonna open the doors for all these different, you know, really creative, effective marketing.
0:46:24.448 --> 0:46:35.528
Luis Escobar
Right. And yeah, we just gotta stick to like that like overarching value, which is like always delivering, over delivering value, over delivering value, right?
0:46:34.288 --> 0:46:44.128
Ted Ennenbach
What is where? Have you talked with Steven anymore about where we're at with HubSpot?
0:46:45.288 --> 0:47:0.488
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we we connected yesterday. It seemed like he he was already also making some progress on on some of the missing fields. I I asked him that to let me do the basic assessments object because I'm I'm.
0:47:1.248 --> 0:47:15.488
Luis Escobar
Pretty deeply working on that with all the the formulas for the basic calculations. So I'll take care of that one myself and I'm overseeing all of them. And yeah, he's he's doing pretty good.
0:47:16.48 --> 0:47:29.728
Ted Ennenbach
Don't, don't, don't, don't forget for him to show you if he has not already all the subjective results of the of the old hormones surveys.
0:47:22.8 --> 0:47:22.488
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:47:30.808 --> 0:47:32.8
Ted Ennenbach
That we have.
0:47:32.488 --> 0:47:35.8
Luis Escobar
And in suite CRM.
0:47:35.288 --> 0:47:47.808
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah. Well, it was in. Was it in? No, it wasn't in sweet. Yeah. Yeah, sweet. Yeah. Not.
0:47:39.8 --> 0:47:39.248
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:47:46.88 --> 0:47:53.408
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I believe so. Yeah, we we did do. We went over a couple of that actually, I think.
0:47:51.768 --> 0:48:10.768
Ted Ennenbach
The reason I say it is because like low energy on the life force that that's also it's almost like it'd be cool for things to be called the same thing and for them to go to the same, but you know, not not have low energy and then.
0:48:11.808 --> 0:48:17.408
Ted Ennenbach
You know, the exact same bucket. I mean, it'd be cool.
0:48:15.768 --> 0:48:27.448
Luis Escobar
I know. Yeah. I know what you mean to make it really... I mean, I I have dreams about like perfect data organization.
0:48:26.728 --> 0:48:32.8
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, I don't think anything will ever be exactly right, but.
0:48:32.808 --> 0:48:48.8
Luis Escobar
My, I think the the way I'm picturing this going is like, there's going to be a lot of legacy fields, right? They're going to be titled legacy fields, right? And then they would with a certain degree of confidence, we're going to like sunset these legacy fields.
0:48:39.768 --> 0:48:41.568
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah.
0:48:48.8 --> 0:48:53.888
Luis Escobar
Or merge them with our new fields, right? But yeah, we have to.
0:48:52.728 --> 0:49:9.8
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, but, but, but, but just to give away that data and say it's not worth anything would suck because, I mean, even if it's 567 year, year, year, years old.
0:48:55.408 --> 0:48:56.48
Luis Escobar
Do you?
0:49:2.648 --> 0:49:3.8
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:49:9.448 --> 0:49:10.168
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:49:9.608 --> 0:49:22.928
Ted Ennenbach
It's something that you knew about them. I mean, it's something that we can market the pharmacy or a new life or tripods or whatever, you know, so.
0:49:17.208 --> 0:49:18.688
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:49:22.248 --> 0:49:39.688
Luis Escobar
Correct. Correct. Yeah. No, it's it's definitely, it's going to be documented. I I'm adamant about that. But like the, yeah, it's definitely going to be a lot of legacy fields and then, you know, some of them make sense to merge, some of them might not fit perfectly with the other ones.
0:49:40.208 --> 0:49:43.8
Luis Escobar
So we'll have to address them case by case.
0:49:44.648 --> 0:50:4.288
Ted Ennenbach
All right, ma'am. OK, well, I'm going to work on putting some narration together. Not so much in like the spoken word and like what's said, but just kind of a lot of buzz terms, exciting terms about what, what?
0:50:4.408 --> 0:50:19.168
Ted Ennenbach
What we're doing, how we're doing it, why we're doing it, you know the the what and the why and and what what what exactly like like you said those pillars are I think really important so.
0:50:8.448 --> 0:50:8.928
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:50:16.968 --> 0:50:18.648
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, man.
0:50:19.808 --> 0:50:33.968
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it's it's it's exciting next. I mean this whole next couple days are going to be, there's going to be a lot of things moving and coming to life finally. I do also want to have like a good go ahead.
0:50:30.168 --> 0:50:32.328
Ted Ennenbach
I I don't like.
0:50:34.408 --> 0:50:37.288
Ted Ennenbach
No, I just you know the problem with.
0:50:39.568 --> 0:50:44.448
Ted Ennenbach
Cliff is that he's um.
0:50:46.8 --> 0:51:1.8
Ted Ennenbach
Well, I mean, if he's busy, he's busy. He's just, he's one of the the those guys that's just very content, you know, I mean like he you won't see that guy working past, you know, I mean.
0:51:2.448 --> 0:51:15.328
Ted Ennenbach
He's kind of the Burning Man kind of dude, you know, I mean so, but he he's really but but he but he's really good so.
0:51:9.528 --> 0:51:12.128
Luis Escobar
I could see that vibe, yeah.
0:51:16.48 --> 0:51:17.88
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:51:19.248 --> 0:51:24.368
Ted Ennenbach
He'll live a lot longer than me for for sure. I mean, there's no doubt, so.
0:51:20.408 --> 0:51:20.928
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:51:23.288 --> 0:51:42.728
Luis Escobar
No, I mean I I was telling Cliff like I you know if we can you know get you know your two cents right to to get this initial launch right going right. But the way I really see it is like you know we should really like focus like hey two weeks from now we want to really launch an.
0:51:42.768 --> 0:51:59.688
Luis Escobar
Official hair campaign, not not just a simple landing page, like a really thoughtfully put together hair campaign with a real elaborate, you know, not just a landing page, but like a video to go along with it and and 12 social media posts to go along with it and.
0:51:59.808 --> 0:52:3.408
Luis Escobar
30 days from now, we launched the hair campaign, right?
0:52:0.368 --> 0:52:5.488
Ted Ennenbach
I our bread and butter though our we we need to get our.
0:52:6.408 --> 0:52:24.328
Ted Ennenbach
Providers busy. So I mean selling as much of the telehealth, selling as much of the anti-ageing hormone peptide that that's where where we need to be. And I understand all these are like individual micro hooks, right?
0:52:10.408 --> 0:52:10.888
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:52:23.8 --> 0:52:23.808
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:52:25.888 --> 0:52:35.608
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, they're all but, but, but I mean, lifeforce doesn't have any of that. They they just have a really great homepage, you know?
0:52:35.728 --> 0:52:50.48
Luis Escobar
I mean they I've been really studying their their Instagram. They are posting frequently. I I don't know. Have you been following them or I turned on post notifications for them so I get every post.
0:52:48.488 --> 0:52:52.488
Ted Ennenbach
No, I I I don't. How do you turn that on?
0:52:54.288 --> 0:52:58.928
Luis Escobar
Um, just go to their Instagram page and then you gotta click the three little dots.
0:53:0.848 --> 0:53:8.808
Luis Escobar
But what I'm seeing there, I mean, they they're they're telling a story and all kinds. They're telling very different kinds of stories.
0:53:10.928 --> 0:53:11.48
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:53:13.648 --> 0:53:21.448
Ted Ennenbach
Let's see about this account. See shared activity. Hide your story. Share the profile.
0:53:24.88 --> 0:53:25.608
Ted Ennenbach
What do you click?
0:53:27.288 --> 0:53:29.88
Ted Ennenbach
The three dots.
0:53:30.48 --> 0:53:37.368
Luis Escobar
Yeah, do you see that? Like turn on post notifications, turn on real notifications.
0:53:31.88 --> 0:53:31.968
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, but.
0:53:34.528 --> 0:53:35.48
Ted Ennenbach
Uh, maybe it's.
0:53:37.768 --> 0:53:40.848
Ted Ennenbach
Is it on your desktop?
0:53:42.288 --> 0:53:47.928
Luis Escobar
No, no, I'm I'm trying to log into my Instagram here.
0:53:46.328 --> 0:54:1.48
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, so so it's just showing me restrict block report about this account, see see shared activity, hide your story. No, there there's not here. I mean you can see.
0:53:56.968 --> 0:53:57.608
Luis Escobar
And on both.
0:54:1.408 --> 0:54:6.88
Ted Ennenbach
There's nothing. I don't know if you can read it or not.
0:54:4.768 --> 0:54:9.888
Luis Escobar
No. Yeah, that's not it. Yeah, close that. Let's see, it's.
0:54:10.48 --> 0:54:13.688
Ted Ennenbach
So I'm on the Life Force page.
0:54:13.48 --> 0:54:20.208
Luis Escobar
Oh, the little bell. The little bell. Top right bell. That's what it is.
0:54:17.568 --> 0:54:18.728
Ted Ennenbach
Yes, OK.
0:54:22.288 --> 0:54:23.768
Luis Escobar
Yeah, you turn on their notifications.
0:54:22.808 --> 0:54:22.848
Ted Ennenbach
Oh.
0:54:30.408 --> 0:54:31.128
Ted Ennenbach
Huh. OK.
0:54:32.768 --> 0:54:47.528
Luis Escobar
So what what I'm seeing is that they're they actually have different characters are telling stories and I mean they're saying that they're they're existing or real patrons, real customers could be true.
0:54:47.928 --> 0:54:48.248
Luis Escobar
Maybe not.
0:54:49.608 --> 0:55:2.168
Ted Ennenbach
So, So what they're doing is they're actually following sort of like what what like we we were saying they're following somebody along.
0:54:59.608 --> 0:54:59.728
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:55:3.568 --> 0:55:4.248
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:55:5.568 --> 0:55:7.688
Luis Escobar
I noticed that too, yeah.
0:55:8.928 --> 0:55:10.968
Ted Ennenbach
So is that what what you're saying?
0:55:12.128 --> 0:55:25.528
Luis Escobar
They're not. I mean, not so directly, but they are, you know, they're telling different stories to try to, like, get different people to resonate with them. Right here. Can you see my screen here? What happened?
0:55:24.648 --> 0:55:24.968
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:55:33.888 --> 0:55:37.648
Luis Escobar
And I'm trying to get used to teams, but.
0:55:39.808 --> 0:55:40.808
Luis Escobar
Here we go, OK.
0:55:42.448 --> 0:55:46.768
Luis Escobar
I mean, here we have Asian girl.
0:55:49.488 --> 0:55:55.328
Luis Escobar
Nine ways to minimize your exposure to plastics. I mean, here they're speaking to those, you know.
0:55:57.608 --> 0:55:57.848
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:56:0.608 --> 0:56:1.848
Luis Escobar
The Burning Man type.
0:56:5.8 --> 0:56:7.88
Luis Escobar
The case for sun exposure.
0:56:8.48 --> 0:56:10.448
Luis Escobar
Introducing P cognition.
0:56:12.8 --> 0:56:19.48
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, they're they're getting to. They want you to buy their supplement, yeah.
0:56:19.528 --> 0:56:21.328
Luis Escobar
The regular dude.
0:56:22.848 --> 0:56:27.568
Luis Escobar
Bougie looking girl. Regular looking dad.
0:56:28.528 --> 0:56:33.608
Luis Escobar
Really fit guy. Young girl.
0:56:38.208 --> 0:56:48.288
Luis Escobar
But they're they're striking all the different angles, right? To see what sticks, not to see what. I mean, it's, you know, it's the name of the game, right? Let let the data speak for itself if.
0:56:48.448 --> 0:57:4.848
Ted Ennenbach
Well, that that that's almost more of what our social. I mean that that's what we need our team doing more of like this. Not not funny Instagram photos of girls doing talks and whatever. I mean, we need more of this.
0:56:55.528 --> 0:56:56.168
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:57:3.968 --> 0:57:4.248
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:57:6.168 --> 0:57:22.728
Luis Escobar
Yeah, man, I I mean, I I'm, I'm excited to just, you know get the initial launch going and then we can have a real deep dive marketing meeting and and do focus the whole week on marketing. I I have a lot of ideas for how you should be doing your your Instagram marketing, your e-mail marketing.
0:57:15.8 --> 0:57:15.328
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:57:16.448 --> 0:57:17.88
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:57:24.8 --> 0:57:24.288
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:57:24.408 --> 0:57:25.368
Luis Escobar
Your text marketing.
0:57:28.328 --> 0:57:46.248
Ted Ennenbach
OK, so so so so do you think the I mean I always thought that the first first step was getting our homepage solid or at least getting a newlife.com up and that homepage having the look and feel that that that we want.
0:57:28.408 --> 0:57:29.848
Luis Escobar
Which is good, yeah.
0:57:46.968 --> 0:57:52.768
Ted Ennenbach
And from that everything else would would follow. Is that the right way to be thinking or not?
0:57:53.248 --> 0:58:10.408
Luis Escobar
It it is, but it's not just the home page, right? It's a little bit more than that. It's I would say it's like what I really wanted to make sure we had covered was like the underlying foundation and for example, the affiliate program, right? It's already built in.
0:57:57.288 --> 0:57:57.888
Ted Ennenbach
Right, right, right, right, right.
0:58:11.88 --> 0:58:26.808
Luis Escobar
So everybody who becomes a user of venulife.com, they're instantly receiving their affiliate credentials, right? So even if if they don't buy a single thing from us, they can share that link with their neighbor and.
0:58:22.568 --> 0:58:22.808
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:58:27.488 --> 0:58:31.128
Luis Escobar
They'll receive Commission in the other weeks.
0:58:31.328 --> 0:58:41.448
Ted Ennenbach
But but I mean, we shouldn't have to wait too long for Cliff to have brand standards, colors, fonts, that kind of thing down pat.
0:58:42.208 --> 0:58:48.248
Luis Escobar
Yeah, the sooner he sends that to, you know, I'll, I'll put it into play, right? Um.
0:58:49.88 --> 0:59:5.88
Luis Escobar
I do think it's also like not too different from your existing like the current font, the Josephine font. We're gonna definitely use that one for example, and the yellow there's still, you know, I don't want to.
0:58:56.968 --> 0:58:57.168
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:59:5.168 --> 0:59:11.488
Luis Escobar
Completely take it away. I think there's still room for it, but there's a part of me that's also leaning on Blues.
0:59:12.128 --> 0:59:21.88
Luis Escobar
There's a part of me that's also kind of leaning on that, like earth tones, like life force has it.
0:59:21.808 --> 0:59:36.928
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, yeah. The the, the, the, the black and gold was more of a designer luxury type look feel.
0:59:22.368 --> 0:59:22.728
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:59:36.968 --> 0:59:41.568
Ted Ennenbach
Exclusive kind of thing, but but um.
0:59:43.408 --> 0:59:57.768
Ted Ennenbach
You know kind of like you you were you were part of something that was best in class I mean you know so but but but but I'm not married to anything I mean really so.
0:59:52.488 --> 0:59:52.968
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
0:59:58.648 --> 0:59:58.768
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:59:59.728 --> 0:59:59.848
Luis Escobar
Um.
1:0:5.968 --> 1:0:7.888
Ted Ennenbach
Good. All right, well, wait.
1:0:6.648 --> 1:0:23.88
Luis Escobar
And what I'll also say about the these logos like can we get some press of a new life maybe soon like some good presses like on on some major.
1:0:23.408 --> 1:0:28.288
Luis Escobar
Um, news outlets? I feel like that can help.
1:0:25.488 --> 1:0:32.368
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, let me work on that. We had actually subscribed to.
1:0:34.688 --> 1:0:42.248
Ted Ennenbach
I need need to find out exactly what what we subscribe to, but yeah, we can't for sure.
1:0:37.528 --> 1:0:38.88
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:0:41.488 --> 1:0:55.768
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, I have a few resources. I'll I'll share those as well. There's also another, you know, we're talking about like Instagram marketing. Who who is your graphic designer right now? Like your who's doing the social media post?
1:0:54.608 --> 1:1:9.128
Ted Ennenbach
Theo Theo works for Marissa, so if you look at the I shared a documented theme.
1:1:9.888 --> 1:1:25.288
Ted Ennenbach
But I can kind of summarize it. Marissa is kind of over the the design copy.
1:1:13.488 --> 1:1:14.8
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:1:25.608 --> 1:1:45.48
Ted Ennenbach
Content and she has Ilda. Ilda does all the videos and photos and daily type stuff. And then Theo is the Greg graphic designer that works.
1:1:29.568 --> 1:1:30.568
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:1:45.88 --> 1:1:46.328
Ted Ennenbach
It, you know.
1:1:47.928 --> 1:1:50.368
Ted Ennenbach
internationally um
1:1:51.448 --> 1:2:10.688
Luis Escobar
OK, OK. So no, yeah, I I understood pretty much that part. Yeah. The reason I ask is cause like you know, to do really good social media marketing, we need to do a lot of content. The the way we were able to grow main interventor to over 10 million followers is.
1:1:51.768 --> 1:1:52.888
Ted Ennenbach
Uh, so yeah.
1:2:0.48 --> 1:2:0.168
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
1:2:11.328 --> 1:2:27.448
Luis Escobar
We were posting like 1520 times a day and but we're not going to do that either. But we do want like an excessive amount of content, right? And so this is a company called nlc.com, nolimit.com.
1:2:14.288 --> 1:2:17.208
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, so.
1:2:27.968 --> 1:2:36.648
Luis Escobar
I've worked with them for several months now and I I really like them and basically what you're getting is for for these different packages.
1:2:37.968 --> 1:2:55.168
Luis Escobar
For 1000 bucks a month, you're getting access to 200 really talented designers and and video editors, right? And what I really like about their system is like they have a platform where like you log in and you submit your request. Oh, I need a.
1:2:56.128 --> 1:3:2.968
Luis Escobar
You know a new carousel, right? And then it goes into the like the request.
1:3:5.48 --> 1:3:20.408
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I got someone working on a pitch deck right now and there's like commentary and feedback and the turn around time is like pretty good actually. I like this feature. So they they send me a video and then I can just go in here and say.
1:3:17.8 --> 1:3:17.168
Ted Ennenbach
Mm.
1:3:22.8 --> 1:3:22.288
Luis Escobar
Oh, yes.
1:3:24.568 --> 1:3:25.648
Luis Escobar
Uh, this one.
1:3:25.808 --> 1:3:40.648
Ted Ennenbach
Well, **** yeah, man. I mean, like, yeah, if we could replace salaries with this, I mean, like, I mean, if Barissa could could manage that, then yeah.
1:3:33.168 --> 1:3:33.448
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:3:40.968 --> 1:3:47.848
Luis Escobar
No, for sure. She it's, you know, it's her ideation, her vision, right? But now she's got access to 200 designers.
1:3:49.928 --> 1:4:7.8
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, but as long as they all maintain the same same brand standards, right. I mean like like we we we that that's what we need Cliff for, right. We we need Cliff for that. You know this is how you can do the logo. This is how you can you know these are the colors, the fonts, the.
1:3:56.648 --> 1:3:57.248
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:4:7.8 --> 1:4:26.168
Luis Escobar
They these people also I've had them make me a brand guideline before too. So like when you sign up with them, the first meeting is a brand like on onboarding. So see here I got they know about two brands, Alpha Hub and FN Capital, right. So and and there's like 20.
1:4:7.288 --> 1:4:8.168
Ted Ennenbach
Whatever.
1:4:18.248 --> 1:4:18.408
Ted Ennenbach
Mm.
1:4:24.48 --> 1:4:24.808
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:4:26.848 --> 1:4:40.888
Luis Escobar
Any specific designers assigned to each brand and they have like a whole insight on what those brands are and what they stand for. So every time we make a request, we can say I need a new design, I need a new ad for.
1:4:43.168 --> 1:5:1.888
Luis Escobar
New life or or a new design for a new life man or we can you know create these sub brands and they'll know what we need, right? And they they do also video graphic and they even do like web UI and they can help us like design your really nice looking app and liking.
1:5:2.128 --> 1:5:12.208
Luis Escobar
But yeah, this is 1 resource I wanted to share with you cause like it really we're about to like there's about to be a need for content, a real a real need for content.
1:5:12.528 --> 1:5:12.728
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:5:16.8 --> 1:5:16.248
Ted Ennenbach
Um.
1:5:18.648 --> 1:5:19.208
Ted Ennenbach
So.
1:5:20.688 --> 1:5:23.368
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, I know at least.
1:5:24.768 --> 1:5:42.408
Ted Ennenbach
Additionally speaking, you know, we we always thought folks like seeing photos of us, you know, photos of the actual person that's going to do the talks or do the facial or whatever. Is that not as important? I mean, is that, you know, I mean actual.
1:5:42.928 --> 1:5:50.288
Ted Ennenbach
Real people saying how like happy they are or whatever is that is that important?
1:5:48.368 --> 1:6:4.568
Luis Escobar
I think there's a lot of truth to that for sure. And then, you know, we should just think about this very strategically, right? Like there should be like a probably like a content day at the at all five of your locations, right? And everyone, you know, comes in with a haircut and and.
1:6:4.848 --> 1:6:23.568
Luis Escobar
We we don't just also like tell them to think what's on their mind. We also like have some script ready for them. So we make it easy for them. We don't want to make them work more than we're already asking them to stand here, read this, right? Smile, right? But we knock out, you know, I don't know, a bunch of videos.
1:6:24.168 --> 1:6:34.288
Luis Escobar
Now what usually happens is that we're sitting on a bunch of videos and we're waiting for one designer to kind of like, come up with his magical idea.
1:6:31.608 --> 1:6:32.888
Ted Ennenbach
Right, right.
1:6:34.808 --> 1:6:50.968
Ted Ennenbach
I would love to get you access or give give this group access to the Dropbox. What do they have? I mean, do you have somewhere where you can just put a bunch of raw, raw, raw video in there?
1:6:46.288 --> 1:6:47.928
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it's all Dropbox.
1:6:51.8 --> 1:6:55.368
Luis Escobar
Yeah, and I have a Slack channel with like 17 design managers all.
1:6:54.568 --> 1:6:54.888
Ted Ennenbach
Yes.
1:6:57.168 --> 1:7:0.408
Luis Escobar
Some of them make me, some of them don't 'cause I ask for a lot.
1:7:0.528 --> 1:7:1.208
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:7:2.208 --> 1:7:5.848
Luis Escobar
But yeah, this is a this is a a scaling approach.
1:7:7.648 --> 1:7:25.128
Luis Escobar
Right. If we if we sit down and we say, hey, we got a hair campaign or we got a formal campaign, we're going to put, you know, 20K budget on on ads or or paying influencers, right. We need to get these influencers material to promote us.
1:7:24.688 --> 1:7:25.128
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:7:25.328 --> 1:7:36.48
Luis Escobar
So we're gonna, you know, we're gonna not just buy videos. We need to give them like 20 good videos, right? And so this is this company will help us achieve that, right?
1:7:41.648 --> 1:7:43.408
Luis Escobar
And I mean, it's pretty economics.
1:7:42.648 --> 1:7:59.368
Ted Ennenbach
I'm just trying to figure out where everybody fits in. That's all like I'm I'm trying to like, you know, I've got Brian, Marissa, Ilda, Theo, Renzo, Steven.
1:7:48.968 --> 1:7:49.248
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:8:0.88 --> 1:8:11.48
Ted Ennenbach
Renzo and Stephen aren't really marketing per SE. They're more, you know, the IT connection type stuff. So, so you know.
1:8:7.768 --> 1:8:8.648
Luis Escobar
I think.
1:8:11.208 --> 1:8:12.328
Luis Escobar
I hear you.
1:8:14.48 --> 1:8:30.728
Luis Escobar
I think you know the way things are going right now that's I mean this is I haven't even shown you some of the AI you know softwares that I I I can give you access to that that's gonna really like make your team more productive and in terms of getting more insight and just like.
1:8:31.8 --> 1:8:33.568
Luis Escobar
I think uh.
1:8:32.48 --> 1:8:48.808
Ted Ennenbach
I just feel like like the content. I mean, I I somebody needs to be able to be. I don't know that I have the senior leadership. In fact, I don't think I do of like the vision of where we're going and the amount of content that we need.
1:8:49.408 --> 1:8:55.568
Ted Ennenbach
To compete at this level, so like that's.
1:8:58.208 --> 1:9:0.528
Ted Ennenbach
But I want to be able to.
1:8:58.688 --> 1:9:4.88
Luis Escobar
I hear you. I mean, yeah, I mean, you have a solid team, brother. Yeah, now you got me. So, I mean.
1:9:5.328 --> 1:9:9.128
Luis Escobar
We're gonna make it happen. We're gonna make it happen and.
1:9:5.528 --> 1:9:5.848
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:9:9.128 --> 1:9:27.408
Ted Ennenbach
Well, just be sure to delegate as much as you can and give me direct direction to as far as like, look, I need her to focus on this. I need, you know, I mean, because right now I I'm not. I mean, there's so much on my plate.
1:9:27.808 --> 1:9:46.728
Ted Ennenbach
Just with everything else that we're doing, like I'm really not overseeing any of that. So and if nobody's overseeing it, I don't know who is and and we're we're still running these separate socials, right? We have a new aesthetics and we have a new.
1:9:27.928 --> 1:9:28.408
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:9:29.808 --> 1:9:30.568
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:9:36.448 --> 1:9:38.408
Luis Escobar
Gotcha. Gotcha. Oh, yeah.
1:9:47.248 --> 1:9:50.448
Ted Ennenbach
Optical health, you know and.
1:9:51.728 --> 1:9:54.248
Ted Ennenbach
To me, that doesn't really make sense, but um.
1:9:57.248 --> 1:10:13.368
Luis Escobar
I got you, brother. I'm going to put some thought into this because I I do have a path where I I can really like, you know, do you know, be there for a new pretty much full-time. We're talking 40 plus hours.
1:10:13.648 --> 1:10:31.728
Luis Escobar
With if I arrange my other projects in a certain way, right. And I mean the reason I say this is because it's actually something that I'm thinking about because I I really enjoy what you guys are doing. I I really think I can really help you here. Like I really think I have the skills you need to pull this off.
1:10:31.808 --> 1:10:45.328
Luis Escobar
But it's not just me alone. I think we need, you know, a few other players involved too. A few other maybe resources like the one I just shared with you. Right. And and and yeah, that's that's get the whole team in line with the vision, right?
1:10:40.208 --> 1:10:40.488
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:10:41.888 --> 1:10:42.328
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:10:45.528 --> 1:11:4.448
Ted Ennenbach
Well, that that that I think is worth a conversation like, OK, what's the vision like like OK, now that we're further down the road of like where what we want to do, what I mean, what do we really need to make this happen? I mean and and can we get there? I need to raise funds, you know what I mean?
1:10:58.168 --> 1:10:58.408
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:11:0.328 --> 1:11:0.608
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:11:5.248 --> 1:11:6.128
Ted Ennenbach
All that so.
1:11:9.248 --> 1:11:14.968
Luis Escobar
I mean, it's it's really, it's getting cheaper and cheaper to be successful now, especially with AI.
1:11:16.208 --> 1:11:35.208
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, but meantime, I'm burning 25 grand a day with physicians and nurses and everything else on the ground. They're not independent, right? They're not. I mean, I'm paying their salaries, I'm paying their healthcare. So it's like it would be different if I was life force.
1:11:16.448 --> 1:11:17.88
Luis Escobar
Alright, wait.
1:11:26.448 --> 1:11:27.528
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:11:36.488 --> 1:11:36.728
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:11:42.8 --> 1:11:42.448
Luis Escobar
Probably.
1:11:49.208 --> 1:11:49.768
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:11:49.808 --> 1:11:49.968
Luis Escobar
8.
1:11:49.808 --> 1:12:5.208
Ted Ennenbach
They're paying him 20 bucks a visit or 30 bucks a visit, you know, instead of me paying 250 bucks an hour, you know? So I mean, it's like, ****, so you know.
1:11:58.688 --> 1:11:59.48
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:12:4.448 --> 1:12:13.808
Luis Escobar
Have you explored how you could possibly transition from this more like, you know, traditional formats or more 1089 relationship with them?
1:12:8.208 --> 1:12:10.928
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's what I was thinking.
1:12:13.648 --> 1:12:33.288
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, I mean so but but we have to have a volume like like so it's kind of like the cart before the horse. It has to make me why would they do that on one I can just say well half of you are fired and and you know I mean that that that I can certainly do do that.
1:12:14.888 --> 1:12:15.128
Luis Escobar
No.
1:12:18.968 --> 1:12:19.448
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:12:33.408 --> 1:12:49.608
Ted Ennenbach
It just doesn't give us opportunity for growth much past that. So, so you know which which I mean we can contract for physicians easily. I mean there there are services out there that'll do it. You just want them to be.
1:12:45.48 --> 1:12:45.288
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:12:50.8 --> 1:12:50.88
Ted Ennenbach
E.
1:12:51.88 --> 1:13:7.848
Ted Ennenbach
On your team, you know you you want them to believe in what you're doing and for them to be, you know, one-on-one with a new life. You know, I mean, you don't want, you don't want to sign up and see Doctor Ted.
1:12:55.768 --> 1:12:56.488
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:13:0.48 --> 1:13:0.688
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:13:8.408 --> 1:13:21.408
Ted Ennenbach
One month and then Doctor Mary next quarter and then Doctor Lewis the quarter after that. And you know, I mean or or do you care? I mean, ****, I don't know.
1:13:21.888 --> 1:13:37.288
Luis Escobar
Funny you say that. So one thing we we usually have in in the the organizations I work with is a client success manager. This is, you know that that one person that's always on top of them checking in.
1:13:37.728 --> 1:13:45.48
Luis Escobar
He's like usually having conversations about their week and how their grandma's doing and just keeping it real with them, just.
1:13:38.128 --> 1:13:38.728
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:13:44.568 --> 1:14:3.888
Ted Ennenbach
Well, I think that's exactly what I thought. Melissa and Crystal, our our, our telephone team, I mean, they would be doing more of that than than just calling back phone numbers, you know, calling leads. They they would be doing more of that.
1:13:57.248 --> 1:13:57.848
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:14:1.448 --> 1:14:2.8
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:14:4.48 --> 1:14:6.688
Ted Ennenbach
That and the medical.
1:14:7.408 --> 1:14:18.328
Ted Ennenbach
Consistence. They could be doing more of that. You know, you know, are you feeling I you're really creating that personal relationship.
1:14:17.768 --> 1:14:30.968
Luis Escobar
Yeah, building that rapport. I mean, maybe it doesn't have to be I got forever, but especially those first 7-8 weeks, there's a there's frequent check-ins from that client success manager.
1:14:23.488 --> 1:14:23.608
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
1:14:25.88 --> 1:14:25.168
Ted Ennenbach
The.
1:14:29.528 --> 1:14:44.168
Ted Ennenbach
Well, I don't think that our pro program changes. It's, you know, 00 day is when they say, you know, zero day, we get the baseline labs.
1:14:36.408 --> 1:14:36.568
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:14:44.448 --> 1:15:4.168
Ted Ennenbach
Well, we get baseline labs, they come back in seven days for the baseline stories, sign up and then 30 days, then there they get all their meds. They come back in 30 days, they get labs again. Seven days later they get the 1st 30 day checkup and then it's every quarter after that.
1:14:51.888 --> 1:14:52.408
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:15:4.368 --> 1:15:5.368
Ted Ennenbach
But I I think.
1:15:4.728 --> 1:15:5.168
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:15:11.608 --> 1:15:13.288
Luis Escobar
Mhm, mhm.
1:15:13.328 --> 1:15:32.488
Ted Ennenbach
Difference between us and life force in that they say, hey, you sign up with us and then we meet every quarter. Well, ****, you don't want to wait a quarter if something's wrong. I mean, if something's wrong, you want to be able to call them within the 1st 30 days to to to switch up the.
1:15:26.128 --> 1:15:27.8
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:15:28.808 --> 1:15:29.8
Luis Escobar
No.
1:15:34.128 --> 1:15:45.648
Ted Ennenbach
To to dosing and that that does often happen. So I mean you know we and I I think they they do say something about.
1:15:39.808 --> 1:15:40.328
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:15:48.128 --> 1:15:49.168
Ted Ennenbach
24/7.
1:15:48.448 --> 1:16:2.8
Luis Escobar
There has to be a there has to be a frequent drip of value. I've never really liked quarterly subscriptions. Like by the time I get hit again with that quarterly subscription, I forgot what I'm paying for.
1:15:52.568 --> 1:15:52.768
Ted Ennenbach
It.
1:15:55.928 --> 1:15:56.168
Ted Ennenbach
Right.
1:15:59.88 --> 1:15:59.208
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
1:16:1.568 --> 1:16:21.8
Ted Ennenbach
Yep, Yep. Or or worse, you get to a new, new norm and you're like, well, ****, I'll just have my regular physician. I mean, you're not giving me new challenges, new goals. You're not, you know, there's nothing that you're giving me that if I left you, I wouldn't get somewhere else.
1:16:20.928 --> 1:16:21.768
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:16:21.488 --> 1:16:41.48
Ted Ennenbach
And so that's why that's why the scoring and I mean if if they leave us they they no longer have access to to those health scores to those to that scoring or or at least the the scoring isn't be be being updated. That's why the game of the.
1:16:41.168 --> 1:16:45.528
Ted Ennenbach
Cation of this has to be so important is that they don't want to leave.
1:16:45.368 --> 1:16:50.248
Luis Escobar
It should ask you to like, hey, it's been six months, it's time to, you know.
1:16:51.408 --> 1:16:55.528
Luis Escobar
Make sure your your scores are all up to date. Thank you.
1:16:54.288 --> 1:17:14.208
Ted Ennenbach
It it's been 30 days and you haven't updated your how you're feeling. You know, I mean like it should send them a text every other week. Hey, just want to check on your sleep. You know that was one of your goals, one to five, you know, and then that updates, you know, they just answer 33.
1:16:56.528 --> 1:16:57.888
Luis Escobar
In 30 days.
1:17:14.728 --> 1:17:23.888
Ted Ennenbach
Questions via a little web page, you know, a mobile friendly page or an app or whatever and and that's just enough of a.
1:17:25.48 --> 1:17:30.288
Ted Ennenbach
Check in that that that would somehow update their their score.
1:17:30.848 --> 1:17:33.528
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, man. Oh, man.
1:17:31.888 --> 1:17:33.408
Ted Ennenbach
You know.
1:17:35.88 --> 1:17:50.648
Luis Escobar
Wait till we have the app doing push notifications, right? Because we it has to be convenient and simple like we all like wanna do these like things that we know it's gonna benefit us. Like, you know, it just has to be easy and convenient.
1:17:41.408 --> 1:17:41.928
Ted Ennenbach
S.
1:17:50.968 --> 1:17:51.128
Luis Escobar
Right.
1:17:51.888 --> 1:17:57.568
Ted Ennenbach
Well, if we can make it, you know, I mean if we can get HubSpot to.
1:17:59.648 --> 1:18:18.728
Ted Ennenbach
Push out these surveys based on on last known symptoms, then then our providers will know is it getting better or not. If it's not getting better, then ****, we got to do something about it. No, nobody leaves you.
1:18:19.208 --> 1:18:38.688
Ted Ennenbach
Nobody leaves us are are far far fewer folks leave us if they're continuing to achieve goals. So it's when so so we we paid for this huge exit study right and and the 90% of folks left because they.
1:18:28.128 --> 1:18:28.768
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:18:38.768 --> 1:18:53.688
Ted Ennenbach
They felt like they weren't achieving their their goal. I mean, like they were like, ****. I mean, it didn't matter whether it was 19 bucks a month or it was 300 bucks a month. It didn't matter because we wouldn't pay a dollar because you weren't helping me.
1:18:54.8 --> 1:19:9.128
Ted Ennenbach
You know, I mean, so, so I mean like we, we need to know who's on that edge, who, who's achieving goals and who's not, who has goals, who, who and who doesn't have goals that we haven't given them yet, I mean.
1:19:4.328 --> 1:19:4.568
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:19:9.648 --> 1:19:11.768
Ted Ennenbach
Somebody, somebody should always have something.
1:19:14.448 --> 1:19:26.248
Luis Escobar
It has to be a really simple interface. So it's like, you know, yes, happy, not happy. And that tells us all the information we need to know to take action.
1:19:24.128 --> 1:19:43.728
Ted Ennenbach
You're you're kind of not wrong. I mean, it's just like, how are you today? :) frown frown face. And then it's a frown. Is it sleep? You know this and then you know, well, your last reported that.
1:19:28.848 --> 1:19:30.248
Luis Escobar
You know, yeah.
1:19:38.768 --> 1:19:40.8
Luis Escobar
Mhm, mhm.
1:19:43.968 --> 1:19:59.48
Ted Ennenbach
That's what sucks about our current setup is that we can't go back and say, well, when we asked you the same thing a month ago, you said you were a four out of five or, you know, whatever, and now you're saying you're only a two or whatever.
1:20:1.688 --> 1:20:2.568
Ted Ennenbach
You know.
1:20:2.488 --> 1:20:6.448
Luis Escobar
There's no simple way to like make that correlation between the data points.
1:20:8.128 --> 1:20:26.608
Ted Ennenbach
But but there should be is my my my point is that that we we keep it simple. What are your goals and make sure that that those goals are always on task and if there's any drop, if there's any drop or like if.
1:20:9.408 --> 1:20:11.408
Luis Escobar
Mm-hmm.
1:20:14.88 --> 1:20:14.248
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:20:17.48 --> 1:20:17.528
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:20:22.808 --> 1:20:23.288
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:20:27.8 --> 1:20:44.128
Ted Ennenbach
If you're losing weight, losing weight, losing weight, then you plateau or you just start to gain weight. Well, ****, that should be a call. I mean, I'm like, hey, let's get a call. Like, let's, let's adjust your meds. Let's, let's talk about your activity.
1:20:37.128 --> 1:20:37.928
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:20:39.168 --> 1:20:39.648
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:20:41.328 --> 1:20:41.848
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:20:44.408 --> 1:20:45.888
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
1:20:44.488 --> 1:20:45.168
Ted Ennenbach
What?
1:20:46.688 --> 1:21:6.408
Luis Escobar
Yeah, man, we're we're getting closer and closer. I got you. I'm gonna, you know, put in a couple more hours this evening. Actually, I got a couple of things coming together on the back end and also gonna move the needle on the front end. You know, keep me in the loop with what you know, Cliff says. But basically what I, you know.
1:20:48.728 --> 1:20:48.888
Ted Ennenbach
So.
1:21:6.528 --> 1:21:25.928
Luis Escobar
To them that you know I'm going to still keep charging and and putting together this simple version, right. And but I still think like I look forward to hearing your your input because I think it's going to be really good and we should use it, right. You know. But like, yeah, let me, I want to get something up and running for you guys. I want to, you know, see how we can.
1:21:26.88 --> 1:21:33.528
Luis Escobar
Get some revenue driven from this new website, right? If we can just get some bookings, get some, yeah, yeah.
1:21:29.888 --> 1:21:43.168
Ted Ennenbach
1000%, 1000%, Yes, yes. CCCCCC Miss Escobar. Yeah. So is it too soon to talk to?
1:21:38.328 --> 1:21:38.448
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:21:48.168 --> 1:21:54.128
Ted Ennenbach
Marissa about you using this company or or?
1:21:52.688 --> 1:22:8.168
Luis Escobar
I wouldn't think. I wouldn't say it's too soon. I actually know I have a a relationship with the CEO. I've been having a few messages with him. I'm gonna speak to him about you guys too and and make an introduction.
1:22:8.528 --> 1:22:17.568
Luis Escobar
And then, but yeah, we can definitely start a dialogue and probably sign up to this service in the next couple days or week.
1:22:17.408 --> 1:22:20.88
Ted Ennenbach
I I it just has to be with.
1:22:21.568 --> 1:22:37.8
Ted Ennenbach
Intent, right. Like, like what? Because I don't know that our social media intent is where we want it to be. You know, I mean, I think that if you looked at our Hopin Health.
1:22:22.928 --> 1:22:23.608
Luis Escobar
Mhm.
1:22:33.888 --> 1:22:34.248
Luis Escobar
No.
1:22:37.208 --> 1:22:51.728
Ted Ennenbach
And our aesthetic right right now, I'm not sure that it's the intentful brand building that you're you know that that you you would want to see so.
1:22:52.8 --> 1:23:11.288
Luis Escobar
No, it's. But what I what I'm also seeing is that it's not like enough. It's not. I mean, you saw how many times life horses posting, right? And it's, yeah, you want it to look good at a glance, but the the algorithm, you know, has its way, right? And you just gotta.
1:23:11.648 --> 1:23:18.248
Luis Escobar
Feeded content. Content is king. That's why I'm a big fan of copywriting words and I really do.
1:23:14.728 --> 1:23:23.808
Ted Ennenbach
The only content that that I see, I follow them, but honestly the only content that I see is paid.
1:23:25.488 --> 1:23:42.848
Ted Ennenbach
I mean most everything that they now now maybe that that that'll change now that that I said I I want to see it but but almost everything that they serve serve me is.
1:23:43.368 --> 1:23:45.768
Ted Ennenbach
Is a sponsored ad, so.
1:23:45.968 --> 1:23:56.728
Luis Escobar
For sure, for sure. But there's high correlation between the the social media content and the ads people see, right? So.
1:23:54.528 --> 1:24:0.728
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, right, right, right, right. Whereas with with us, I don't think that there is.
1:24:2.248 --> 1:24:21.8
Luis Escobar
No, I get it. And I know you guys are not doing ads right now on on meta, right? But if if we execute it right, I think we should be doing them, especially retargeting, right? And then it should, it should not feel like a burden, right? We should start with a small little $20 budget and then.
1:24:21.808 --> 1:24:25.208
Luis Escobar
It increases 10% every time we see measurable success.
1:24:26.48 --> 1:24:28.48
Ted Ennenbach
All right, ma'am. Thank you.
