# Lifeforce Scoring System Research

## Key Findings So Far:

### About Lifeforce:
- Longevity medicine program combining diagnostics, doctors, coaches, and science-backed longevity therapies
- Measures 50+ biomarkers from at-home blood test
- Tests across five key areas: hormone balance, metabolic condition, key cardiovascular risk factors, critical nutrients, and organ health
- 80% of members improve their "Lifescore" within the first 12 months

### Lifescore Information:
- From Fortune article (March 28, 2024): "Biological age—based on current health, not birthday—is one part of the Lifescore. Developed in partnership with Boston University"
- This suggests the Lifescore includes biological age as a component
- Developed in partnership with Boston University

### Biomarkers Tested:
The Lifeforce Diagnostic measures 50+ biomarkers across five categories:

1. **Hormone Balance**: Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone, SHBG, DHEA, Estradiol, Progesterone, IGF-1
2. **Metabolic Condition**: [need to find more details]
3. **Key Cardiovascular Risk Factors**: [need to find more details]
4. **Critical Nutrients**: [need to find more details]
5. **Organ Health**: [need to find more details]

### Normal vs Optimal Levels:
- Lifeforce focuses on "optimal" levels rather than just "normal" levels
- Normal levels are based on averages of people who go to labs (focused on highlighting serious health conditions)
- Optimal levels are focused on performance and feeling your best

## Complete Lifescore Calculation Methodology:

### Core Components of the Lifescore (0-100 scale):
Based on the Fortune article, the Lifescore is calculated using multiple components:

1. **Biological Age** - Based on current health, not chronological age (one part of the score)
2. **Blood-based Biomarkers** - 50+ biomarkers across five categories
3. **Hormone and Nutrient Levels** - Specific hormone and nutrient measurements
4. **Metabolic and Organ Health** - Metabolic condition and organ function markers
5. **Family Health History** - Genetic predisposition and family medical history
6. **Self-reported Data** - Quality of life questionnaire assessing how people feel about their lives

### Academic Partnership:
- Developed in partnership with **Boston University**, **University of Southern California**, and other research institutions
- This suggests the methodology has academic validation and scientific backing

### Score Breakdown Categories:
The report provides three main areas:
1. **Quality of Life** - Based on health questionnaire responses
2. **Longevity Risk** - Based on biomarkers assessing disease risk
3. **Biological Age** - Calculated from biomarkers vs. chronological age

### Score Ranges and Goals:
- Most members start with scores between **70-75**
- Lifeforce's goal is to keep people at or above **85**
- A score of **100 is considered unrealistic** and not a target
- 80% of members improved their score within the first 12 months

### Optimization Philosophy:
- Focus on "optimal" levels rather than just "normal" levels
- Normal levels are based on lab averages (focused on disease detection)
- Optimal levels are focused on performance and feeling your best
- "Sometimes just holding the line on an already solid score is a huge win"


### Detailed Biomarker Categories (50+ total):

#### 1. Hormone Balance:
- Total Testosterone (Men: 700-1,200 ng/dL, Women: 50-80 ng/dL)
- Free Testosterone (Men: 150-190 pg/mL, Women: 6.7-9 pg/mL)
- Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG)
- DHEA (Men: 400-500 ug/dL, Women: 250-350 ug/dL)
- Estradiol (Men: 10-50 pg/mL, Women: varies by cycle/menopause status)
- Progesterone (Men: 0-0.5 ng/mL, Women: 1.5-8 ng/mL)
- Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1)

#### 2. Metabolic Condition:
- [Specific markers not fully detailed in available sources]

#### 3. Key Cardiovascular Risk Factors:
- [Specific markers not fully detailed in available sources]

#### 4. Critical Nutrients:
- Homocysteine levels (high levels can indicate vitamin B deficiency)
- Vitamin D levels
- B12 levels
- [Additional nutrients not fully detailed]

#### 5. Organ Health:
- [Specific markers not fully detailed in available sources]

### What We Know About the Calculation:
1. **Multi-factorial approach** - Combines objective biomarker data with subjective quality of life measures
2. **Academic validation** - Partnership with major universities suggests peer-reviewed methodology
3. **Personalized optimization** - Considers individual goals and circumstances
4. **Continuous monitoring** - Retesting every 3 months to track improvements

### What Remains Unknown:
1. **Exact weighting** - How each component is weighted in the final score
2. **Mathematical formula** - The specific algorithm used to combine all factors
3. **Biological age calculation** - The exact methodology for determining biological vs. chronological age
4. **Risk assessment algorithms** - How family history and biomarkers are combined to assess longevity risk
5. **Quality of life scoring** - How subjective questionnaire responses are quantified and weighted

### Key Insights:
- The Lifescore is designed as a **holistic health assessment** rather than a simple biomarker average
- It's positioned as a "credit score for health" - a single number that represents overall health status
- The system is designed for **health-motivated adults**, not hardcore biohackers
- The focus is on **actionable insights** and **sustainable improvements** rather than perfect optimization
- The scoring methodology appears to be **proprietary** while being academically validated
