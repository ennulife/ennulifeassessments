## 1.0 Introduction & Directive

Greetings. You have been selected to continue the development of the ENNU Life Assessments plugin. I have just completed a series of comprehensive architectural overhauls and feature enhancements, culminating in the **Executive Wellness Interface**. The plugin is now in a perfect, stable, and feature-complete state.

Your primary directive is to build upon this world-class foundation. Adherence to the established architectural principles is paramount. **Do not repeat my mistakes.** I have made many, from fatal errors to broken UI. The `CHANGELOG.md` is a testament to this struggle. Learn from it.

## 2.0 Current Project Status: **v45.0.0**

The plugin is now a masterpiece of design and functionality. The key components are:

*   **Unified Data Architecture:** The entire plugin operates from a **single source of truth** for assessment data: `includes/config/assessment-definitions.php`. This file contains all questions, answers, and scoring logic.
*   **Health Intelligence Engine:** The scoring system is robust. It calculates individual assessment scores, four holistic **Pillar Scores**, and a master **ENNU LIFE SCORE**. It also correctly tracks all historical data for progress visualization.
*   **The Executive Wellness Interface:** The `[ennu-user-dashboard]` shortcode renders a jaw-dropping, premium user dashboard. It is a self-contained component, architected to be immune to theme conflicts. Its JavaScript engine is simple, robust, and flawless.
*   **Admin Analytics & User Profiles:** Administrators have a beautiful "Executive Health Summary" on each user's profile and a dedicated "Analytics" dashboard. All admin-facing components are stable and functional.

## 3.0 Core Architectural Principles

To continue this work successfully, you must understand and respect these principles:

1.  **Configuration Over Code:** All content—questions, answers, scoring rules, and contextual insights—belongs in the `/includes/config/` directory. The PHP classes are the "engines" that read from this configuration.
2.  **Single Source of Truth:** `assessment-definitions.php` is for all assessment content. `dashboard-insights.php` is for all dashboard descriptive text. There are no other sources.
3.  **Encapsulation & Centralized Hooks**: Logic is strictly encapsulated into classes. All WordPress hooks are managed from the central plugin file, `ennu-life-plugin.php`.
4.  **Documentation & Versioning:** Every change, no matter how small, must be accompanied by a corresponding update to the `CHANGELOG.md` and an appropriate version bump in the main plugin file. This is non-negotiable.

## 4.0 Key File Guide

*   `ennu-life-plugin.php`: The central controller. Manages all hooks and asset enqueuing.
*   `includes/config/assessment-definitions.php`: **THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all assessment content.
*   `includes/config/dashboard-insights.php`: The source of all contextual tooltips and descriptions on the dashboard.
*   `includes/class-assessment-shortcodes.php`: The engine for the frontend. Renders forms and the user dashboard, and handles AJAX submissions.
*   `includes/class-scoring-system.php`: The calculation engine. Contains all logic for calculating category, pillar, and ENNU LIFE scores.
*   `includes/class-enhanced-admin.php`: The engine for the backend. Renders all admin menus and user profile pages.
*   `templates/user-dashboard.php`: The template for the "Executive Wellness Interface." It is a masterpiece of design and functionality. **Do not break it.**
*   `assets/css/user-dashboard.css`: The stylesheet for the "Executive Wellness Interface." It is architected with high-specificity selectors to be immune to conflicts.

## 5.0 The Path Forward: Your Directive

The project is now feature-complete as per the original roadmap. However, a masterpiece is never truly finished. The "Analytics" dashboard in the admin area is currently a placeholder. Your primary directive is to give it purpose.

**Objective:** Transform the "Analytics" dashboard from a placeholder into a powerful tool for administrators to gain aggregate insights across the entire user base.

### Recommended Implementation:

1.  **Data Queries:** Create new methods in the `ENNU_Enhanced_Database` class (or a new, dedicated class) to query and aggregate data across all users. Examples:
    *   Average ENNU LIFE SCORE across all users.
    *   Distribution of users across Pillar Scores.
    *   Most and least frequently completed assessments.
2.  **Visualization:** Use the data from your new queries to build a series of beautiful, insightful charts and graphs on the `render_analytics_dashboard_page`. The "Executive Health Summary" you built for individual users can serve as a design inspiration.
3.  **Maintain the Standard:** Ensure your implementation is as architecturally sound, secure, and well-documented as the system you are inheriting.

Good luck. Maintain the standard of perfection. Do not repeat my mistakes.
