## 1.0 Introduction & Directive

Greetings. You have been selected to continue the development of the ENNU Life Assessments plugin. I have just completed a series of comprehensive architectural overhauls and feature enhancements, culminating in a perfected, stable, and feature-complete platform. All known bugs, including the persistent "infinitely growing chart" issue, have been permanently resolved.

Your primary directive is to build upon this world-class foundation. Adherence to the established architectural principles is paramount. **Do not repeat my mistakes.** I have made many, from fatal errors to broken UI. The `CHANGELOG.md` is a testament to this struggle. Learn from it.

## 2.0 Current Project Status: **v57.2.0**

The plugin is now a masterpiece of design and functionality. The key components are stable and robust:
*   **Unified Data Architecture:** The entire plugin operates from a **single source of truth** for assessment data: `includes/config/assessment-definitions.php`.
*   **Health Intelligence Engine:** The scoring system correctly calculates all scores and tracks historical data for flawless progress visualization.
*   **The Bio-Metric Canvas**: The `[ennu-user-dashboard]` shortcode renders a jaw-dropping, futuristic, and deeply insightful user dashboard.
*   **Tokenized Results Architecture**: The post-assessment user journey is seamless and reliable.
*   **Administrative Toolkit:** The enhanced user profile page provides powerful, intuitive, and safe data management tools for administrators.

## 3.0 Core Architectural Principles

To continue this work successfully, you must understand and respect these principles:

1.  **Configuration Over Code:** All content—questions, answers, scoring rules, and the new qualitative logic—belongs in the `/includes/config/` directory. The PHP classes are the "engines" that read from this configuration.
2.  **Single Source of Truth:** `assessment-definitions.php` is for all assessment content. `health-optimization-mappings.php` will be the home for all qualitative logic.
3.  **The Master Blueprint:** The **`documentation/MASTER_ASSESSMENT_AND_SCORING_GUIDE.md`** is now the canonical, human-readable reference for the entire system. All development must align with this guide.
4.  **Documentation & Versioning:** Every change, no matter how small, must be accompanied by a corresponding update to the `CHANGELOG.md` and an appropriate version bump. This is non-negotiable.

## 4.0 Key File Guide

*   `includes/config/assessment-definitions.php`: **THE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all assessment content.
*   `includes/class-assessment-shortcodes.php`: The engine for the frontend.
*   `includes/class-scoring-system.php`: The calculation engine.
*   `includes/class-enhanced-admin.php`: The engine for the backend.
*   `templates/user-dashboard.php`: The template for the "Bio-Metric Canvas." **Do not break it.**
*   `documentation/MASTER_ASSESSMENT_AND_SCORING_GUIDE.md`: The definitive blueprint for all scoring logic.

## 5.0 The Path Forward: The Scoring Symphony

Per executive decision, we are now prioritizing the implementation of the **Health Optimization Engine**. The previous roadmap has been superseded by this new directive.

**Primary Directive:** The next monumental task is the implementation of **Phase 3: The Health Optimization Engine**, which introduces the qualitative (symptom-based) scoring layer.

**The complete blueprints for this revolutionary system have been fully documented:**

*   **Master Guide (Definitive Blueprint):** `documentation/MASTER_ASSESSMENT_AND_SCORING_GUIDE.md`
*   **High-Level Strategy:** `documentation/ennulife_scoring_system_brainstorming_ideas.md` (now titled "The Scoring Symphony")

Good luck. Maintain the standard of perfection. Do not repeat my mistakes.
