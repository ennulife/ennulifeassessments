# Version 78.0.0 - Dashboard Chart Improvements
**Release Date:** January 15, 2025

## üéØ Major Improvements

### Dashboard Weight Chart System
- **Fixed Critical Chart Rendering Issues**
  - Resolved JavaScript syntax error (duplicate `chartWidth` declaration) that prevented all charts from loading
  - Charts now render properly with connecting lines between data points
  - Fixed SVG path generation and rendering logic

### Real Weight History Implementation
- **Authentic Data Display**
  - Dashboard now uses actual weight history from database
  - Removed hardcoded fake data ("1 month ago", "2 months ago")
  - Weight history initializer creates only current entry, not artificial historical data
  
- **Accurate Date Labels**
  - Proper relative time display:
    - "Today" for current date
    - "Yesterday" for 1 day ago
    - "X days ago" for recent dates (2-6 days)
    - "X weeks ago" for dates within a month
    - "X months ago" for older dates
    - Actual date (e.g., "Jan 15, 2024") for very old entries

### Data Preservation
- **Historical Weight Protection**
  - Fixed weight update handler to preserve historical weights
  - Only today's entry updates when current weight changes
  - Removed incorrect proportional recalculation logic
  - BMI values recalculated correctly without modifying weights

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Fixed Mobile Display Issues**
  - Removed fixed height constraints causing hidden elements
  - Added comprehensive mobile CSS fixes
  - Charts properly scale on mobile devices
  - All dashboard elements now visible and accessible

2. **user-dashboard.php**
