# Dashboard Weight Chart Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
There were 2 weight charts rendering on the dashboard:
1. One from `initializeWeightBMIChart()` in user-dashboard.php
2. One from `renderWeightBMIChart()` in score-mini-charts.js

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Single Chart Approach
- Modified `initializeWeightBMIChart()` to only look for `.weight-bmi-detailed-chart` container (which doesn't exist)
- This prevents the duplicate chart from being created
- The mini chart from score-mini-charts.js is now the only chart

### 2. Real Data Integration
- Updated score-mini-charts.js to use real weight history data instead of mock data
- Added `window.weightHistoryData` to pass real weight history from PHP to JavaScript
- Chart now shows actual historical weight progression

### 3. Proper Date Labels
- Weight history now shows accurate relative dates:
  - "Today" for current date
  - "Yesterday" for 1 day ago
  - "X days ago" for recent dates
  - "X weeks ago" for dates within a month
  - "X months ago" for older dates

## Files Modified

1. **user-dashboard.php**
   - Added `window.weightHistoryData` to pass real data to JavaScript
   - Modified `initializeWeightBMIChart()` to prevent duplicate chart
   - Added `formatDateLabel()` function for proper date formatting

2. **score-mini-charts.js**
   - Updated `renderWeightBMIChart()` to use real weight history
   - Changed label from "Weight & BMI Trend" to "Weight & BMI History"

3. **class-weight-ajax-handler.php**
   - Fixed to preserve historical weights (no recalculation)
   - Only updates today's entry when current weight changes

4. **class-weight-history-initializer.php**
   - Creates only today's entry (not fake historical data)

## How It Works Now

1. **Data Flow:**
   - PHP fetches real weight history from user meta
   - Passes it to JavaScript via `window.weightHistoryData`
   - score-mini-charts.js uses this real data to render the chart

2. **Chart Rendering:**
   - Only one chart renders (from score-mini-charts.js)
   - Uses the unified mini chart system with consistent styling
   - Shows actual weight progression over time

3. **Weight Updates:**
   - When current weight is updated, only today's entry changes
   - Historical weights remain unchanged
   - Chart updates to reflect new data
