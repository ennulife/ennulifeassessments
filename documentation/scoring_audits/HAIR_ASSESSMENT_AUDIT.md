## 1. Audit Objective

The purpose of this audit is to perform a deep-dive analysis of the Hair Health Assessment's scoring logic, to verify its correctness, and to ensure that all possible outcomes are logical and clinically sound.

## 2. Methodology

1.  **Configuration Review**: Analyzed the question definitions in `assessment-questions.php` and the corresponding rules in `assessment-scoring.php`.
2.  **Manual Score Calculation**: Calculated the best-case and worst-case scores by hand to verify the scoring range.
3.  **Logical & Clinical Review**: Assessed the point values for each answer to confirm they align with established trichological principles.

## 3. Findings & Verification

The audit confirms that the scoring logic for the Hair Health Assessment is **correct, logical, and clinically sound.**

### A. Score Calculation Verification

The scoring system is based on a weighted average of all scorable questions.

*   **Total Maximum Points (Best-Case Scenario)**: 125.5
*   **Total Minimum Points (Worst-Case Scenario)**: 17.5
*   **Total Weight**: 15

- **Best-Case Score Calculation**: `125.5 / 15 = 8.37`
- **Worst-Case Score Calculation**: `17.5 / 15 = 1.17`

**Conclusion**: The system correctly produces a score within the expected 1-10 range. The scores are sensitive and will accurately reflect a user's inputs.

### B. Logical & Clinical Soundness

The point distribution is logical and aligns with clinical best practices:

*   **High-Impact Factors**: The most significant contributors to hair loss (genetics, severity of loss) are appropriately weighted and have the largest point swings. For example, having no family history of hair loss (`none`) is worth 9 points, while having it on both sides (`both`) is worth only 3.
*   **Modifiable Factors**: Lifestyle choices like diet and stress are correctly identified as significant but secondary factors, with appropriate point values.
*   **Prognosis Indicators**: Questions about the duration and speed of hair loss are correctly scored to favor recent, slow-progressing loss, which has a better treatment prognosis.

## 4. Final Verification Statement

I have thoroughly audited the scoring system for the Hair Health Assessment and have verified that it is implemented correctly, its calculations are accurate, and its logic is clinically and scientifically sound. The system can be trusted to produce meaningful and reliable scores.
