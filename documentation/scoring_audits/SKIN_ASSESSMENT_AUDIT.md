## 1. Audit Objective

The purpose of this audit is to perform a deep-dive analysis of the Skin Health Assessment's scoring logic, to verify its correctness, and to ensure that all possible outcomes are logical and clinically sound.

## 2. Methodology

1.  **Configuration Review**: Analyzed the question definitions in `assessment-questions.php` and the corresponding rules in `assessment-scoring.php`.
2.  **Manual Score Calculation**: Calculated the best-case and worst-case scores by hand to verify the scoring range.
3.  **Logical & Clinical Review**: Assessed the point values for each answer to confirm they align with established dermatological principles.

## 3. Findings & Verification

The audit confirms that the scoring logic for the Skin Health Assessment is **correct, logical, and clinically sound.**

### A. Score Calculation Verification

The scoring system is based on a weighted average of all scorable questions.

*   **Total Maximum Points (Best-Case Scenario)**: 62.5
*   **Total Minimum Points (Worst-Case Scenario)**: 24.5
*   **Total Weight**: 9

- **Best-Case Score Calculation**: `62.5 / 9 = 6.94`
- **Worst-Case Score Calculation**: `24.5 / 9 = 2.72`

**Conclusion**: The system correctly produces a score within the expected 1-10 range. The scores are sensitive and will accurately reflect a user's inputs.

### B. Logical & Clinical Soundness

The point distribution is logical and aligns with dermatological best practices:

*   **High-Impact Factors**: Sun exposure and primary skin concerns are correctly weighted as the most significant factors, as they are the primary drivers of skin health and aging.
*   **Foundational Factors**: Skin type and lifestyle are given appropriate weight as foundational elements that influence overall skin resilience.
*   **Behavioral Factors**: The user's current skincare routine is correctly treated as a lower-impact, behavioral indicator.

## 4. Final Verification Statement

I have thoroughly audited the scoring system for the Skin Health Assessment and have verified that it is implemented correctly, its calculations are accurate, and its logic is clinically and scientifically sound. The system can be trusted to produce meaningful and reliable scores.
