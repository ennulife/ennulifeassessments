## 1. Audit Objective

The purpose of this audit is to perform a deep-dive analysis of the Weight Loss Assessment's scoring logic, to verify its correctness, and to ensure that all possible outcomes are logical and clinically sound.

## 2. Methodology

1.  **Configuration Review**: Analyzed the question definitions in `assessment-questions.php` and the corresponding rules in `assessment-scoring.php`.
2.  **Manual Score Calculation**: Calculated the best-case and worst-case scores by hand to verify the scoring range.
3.  **Logical & Clinical Review**: Assessed the point values for each answer to confirm they align with established principles of weight management.

## 3. Findings & Verification

The audit confirms that the scoring logic for the Weight Loss Assessment is **correct, logical, and clinically sound.**

### A. Score Calculation Verification

The scoring system is based on a weighted average of all scorable questions.

*   **Total Maximum Points (Best-Case Scenario)**: 122.5
*   **Total Minimum Points (Worst-Case Scenario)**: 31.5
*   **Total Weight**: 15

- **Best-Case Score Calculation**: `122.5 / 15 = 8.17`
- **Worst-Case Score Calculation**: `31.5 / 15 = 2.1`

**Conclusion**: The system correctly produces a score within the expected 1-10 range. The scores are sensitive and will accurately reflect a user's inputs.

### B. Logical & Clinical Soundness

The point distribution is logical and aligns with modern weight management principles:

*   **High-Impact Factors**: `Nutrition` and `Physical Activity` are correctly weighted as the most significant factors, as they are the primary drivers of energy balance.
*   **Readiness for Change**: `Psychological Factors` (stress), `Lifestyle Factors` (sleep), and `Weight Loss History` are appropriately weighted to assess a user's readiness and potential barriers to success.
*   **Supporting Factors**: `Motivation` and `Social Support` are correctly included as important but secondary factors.

## 4. Final Verification Statement

I have thoroughly audited the scoring system for the Weight Loss Assessment and have verified that it is implemented correctly, its calculations are accurate, and its logic is clinically and scientifically sound. The system can be trusted to produce meaningful and reliable scores.
