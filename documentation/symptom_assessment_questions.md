## 1.0 Overview

This document provides a complete reference for the **Health Optimization Assessment**. This is a qualitative, symptom-based assessment designed to help users identify potential areas of health concern. It is not scored in a traditional, quantitative sense. Instead, it gathers subjective data (symptoms) which is then used to generate a textual report and apply intelligent modifiers to the user's main ENNU LIFE SCORE.

This document details the exact questions presented to the user and the complete mapping of every possible symptom to its corresponding health category.
