## 1. Scoring Philosophy & Rationale

This document provides a complete breakdown of the scoring logic for the **ED Treatment Assessment**. The system's philosophy is to assess a user's clinical profile to determine their suitability for treatment and the likely prognosis. A higher score indicates a more straightforward case with a higher probability of successful treatment.

The scoring is weighted based on established clinical guidelines for treating erectile dysfunction:

*   **High Weight**: The most critical factors are the `Condition Severity` and underlying `Medical Factors` (like heart disease or diabetes), as these have the most direct impact on treatment options and outcomes.
*   **Medium Weight**: The `Timeline` (duration of symptoms), `Psychological Factors` (stress), and `Physical Health` (exercise) are given significant weight, as they are key contributors to the condition and can influence treatment success.
*   **Low Weight**: `Psychosocial Factors` (relationship status) and `Treatment Motivation` are included to build a complete patient profile but are weighted less heavily than the primary physiological and medical indicators.

The goal is to produce a score that provides a clear, clinically relevant snapshot of the user's case, helping to guide them toward the most appropriate and effective treatment path.
