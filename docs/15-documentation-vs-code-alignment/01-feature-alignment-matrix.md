## üîç **VALIDATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Phase 1: Feature Existence Check**
- [ ] Verify each documented feature exists in code
- [ ] Check file locations match documentation
- [ ] Validate class and method existence
- [ ] Confirm functionality implementation

### **Phase 2: Functionality Validation**
- [ ] Test each feature's actual functionality
- [ ] Verify integration between components
- [ ] Check for broken or incomplete implementations
- [ ] Validate business logic accuracy

### **Phase 3: Documentation Accuracy**
- [ ] Compare documented claims vs. actual implementation
- [ ] Identify missing or incomplete features
- [ ] Check for overstated capabilities
- [ ] Validate version-specific features

## üö® **CRITICAL GAPS TO INVESTIGATE**

### **1. Four-Engine Scoring Symphony**
**Documented**: Sophisticated four-engine system
**Code Reality**: Need to verify if all engines exist and work together

### **2. Business Model Integration**
**Documented**: Complete revenue model integration
**Code Reality**: Need to verify actual business logic implementation

### **3. Health Goals System**
**Documented**: Full AJAX functionality
**Code Reality**: Need to verify if AJAX endpoints work

### **4. Shortcode Registration**
**Documented**: Critical failure in registration
**Code Reality**: Need to verify if shortcodes actually register

### **5. Assessment Engine Completeness**

**Code Reality**: Need to verify each assessment works properly

## üìà **EXPECTED FINDINGS**

### **Best Case Scenario**
- All documented features exist and work
- Minor documentation inaccuracies
- System is as sophisticated as claimed

### **Worst Case Scenario**
- Many documented features don't exist
- System is much simpler than claimed
- Major functionality gaps

### **Most Likely Scenario**
- Partial feature implementation
- Some features work, some don't
- Documentation overstates capabilities

## üéØ **VALIDATION CHECKLIST**

### **Core Features**
