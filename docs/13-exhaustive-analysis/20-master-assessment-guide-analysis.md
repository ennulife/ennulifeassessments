## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This document is the single, canonical source of truth for the entire ENNU Life assessment and scoring ecosystem. It contains every question, answer, and scoring parameter for all quantitative assessments, as well as the complete architecture for the new **Symptom Qualification Engine**. This guide supersedes all previous, disparate scoring documents.

## **SCORING RATIONALE: THE SCORING SYMPHONY**

The ENNU LIFE SCORE is the result of a "Scoring Symphony" with four distinct movements:

1. **Quantitative Engine (Potential):** Calculates a user's *potential* for health based on self-reported history and lifestyle. Higher point values indicate a better state.

2. **Qualitative Engine (Reality):** Applies a "Pillar Integrity Penalty" based on the *severity and frequency* of a user's real-world symptoms.

3. **Objective Engine (Actuality):** Applies the ultimate "Actuality Adjustment" based on hard biomarker data from lab tests.

4. **Intentionality Engine (Alignment):** Applies a small "Alignment Boost" to reward user focus on their stated goals.

## **QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS**

This section details the assessments that measure a user's health *potential*.

## **QUALITATIVE ENGINE: THE SYMPTOM QUALIFICATION ENGINE**

This section details the new assessment and logic that measures a user's health *reality*. This engine provides a far more nuanced and accurate picture than a simple symptom checklist.

### **3.1 User Experience: Two-Stage Symptom Qualification**

The user will be presented with a dynamic, two-stage assessment:

1. **Stage 1: Symptom Identification:** The user selects all symptoms they are currently experiencing from a high-level list.

2. **Stage 2: Symptom Qualification:** For *each symptom selected*, a sub-form immediately appears, prompting the user to provide crucial context by qualifying the symptom's **Severity** and **Frequency**.

### **3.2 Health Optimization Assessment Questions**

This assessment is a single logical unit, but is presented to the user in two dynamic stages.

#### **Stage 1: Symptom Identification**

**Total Questions:** 25  
**Format:** Multiselect questions covering all major health domains

**Key Question Categories:**
- **Energy & Motivation:** Questions 1-3
- **Sleep & Night-time Issues:** Questions 4-5
- **Mood & Mental Health:** Questions 6-8
- **Cognitive Function:** Questions 9-11
- **Sexual Health:** Questions 12-14
- **Physical Strength & Mobility:** Questions 15-18
- **Cardiovascular Health:** Questions 19-22
- **Body Composition & Metabolism:** Questions 23-24
- **General Health:** Question 25

### **3.3 Symptom-to-Vector Map**

Each identified symptom is mapped to one or more **Health Optimization Vectors**:

**Health Optimization Vectors:**
- **Energy:** Fatigue, Lack of Motivation, Poor Sleep, Muscle Weakness, etc.
- **Hormones:** Anxiety, Depression, Irritability, Hot Flashes, Night Sweats, etc.
- **Heart Health:** Chest Pain, Shortness of Breath, Palpitations, Lightheadedness, etc.
- **Weight Loss:** Abdominal Fat Gain, Blood Glucose Dysregulation, High Blood Pressure, etc.
- **Strength:** Muscle Weakness, Decreased Mobility, Poor Balance, Slow Recovery, etc.
- **Cognitive Health:** Brain Fog, Confusion, Memory Loss, Poor Concentration, etc.
- **Libido:** Low Libido, Erectile Dysfunction, Vaginal Dryness, Low Self-Esteem, etc.
- **Longevity:** Chronic Fatigue, Cognitive Decline, Frequent Illness, Slow Healing, etc.

### **3.4 Pillar Integrity Penalty Matrix**

The core of the engine uses the user's qualified responses (Severity and Frequency) for each Vector to determine the precise penalty to apply to the corresponding Pillar. The highest penalty per pillar is the one that is used.

**Penalty Structure:**
- **Heart Health:** Severe/Daily → Body Pillar: -20%
- **Cognitive Health:** Severe/Daily → Mind Pillar: -20%
- **Hormones:** Severe/Daily → Body Pillar: -10%
- **Weight Loss:** Severe/Daily → Lifestyle Pillar: -10%
- **Strength:** Severe/Daily → Body Pillar: -10%
- **Longevity:** Severe/Daily → Lifestyle Pillar: -10%
- **Energy:** Severe/Daily → Lifestyle Pillar: -8%
- **Libido:** Severe/Daily → Mind Pillar: -8%
