## **DOCUMENT OVERVIEW**
**File:** `docs/03-development/shortcodes.md`  
**Type:** SHORTCODE DOCUMENTATION  
**Status:** COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE  
**Version:** 57.2.1  
**Total Lines:** 92

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This document provides a comprehensive guide to all shortcodes available in the ENNU Life Assessment Plugin. It details the three main categories of shortcodes: Assessment Form Shortcodes, User Account & Results Shortcodes, and Detailed Results Page Shortcodes (The Health Dossier). The documentation reveals a sophisticated shortcode system designed to create a seamless user experience throughout the health assessment journey.

## **LATEST UPDATES (v57.2.1)**

### **FIXED ISSUES**
- ✅ **FIXED**: Assessment pre-population - users no longer need to re-enter gender, DOB, height, weight
- ✅ **FIXED**: Global fields display - Age, Gender, Height, Weight, BMI now properly show on dashboard
- ✅ **FIXED**: Light mode readability - enhanced contrast for scores and contextual text
- ✅ **ENHANCED**: Data persistence and error handling across all assessment types

## **SHORTCODE CATEGORIES**

### **1. ASSESSMENT FORM SHORTCODES**

These shortcodes render the main, multi-step assessment forms on any page or post. Each form is a complete, self-contained experience.

**Available Shortcodes:**
- `[ennu-welcome-assessment]`
- `[ennu-hair-assessment]`
- `[ennu-ed-treatment-assessment]`
- `[ennu-skin-assessment]`
- `[ennu-sleep-assessment]`
- `[ennu-hormone-assessment]`
- `[ennu-menopause-assessment]`
- `[ennu-testosterone-assessment]`
- `[ennu-weight-loss-assessment]`

**Purpose:** Multi-step assessment forms for different health domains
**Behavior:** Complete, self-contained assessment experiences

### **2. USER ACCOUNT & RESULTS SHORTCODES**

These shortcodes render the pages that constitute the core user journey after completing an assessment.

#### **2.1 Main User Dashboard**

**Shortcode:** `[ennu-user-dashboard]`

**Renders:** The main "Bio-Metric Canvas" user dashboard

**Behavior:**
- If the user is not logged in, it will show a beautifully styled login/registration prompt
- If the user is logged in, it displays a card for each assessment relevant to their gender
- Each card shows their latest score and provides links to retake the assessment or view the full "Health Dossier"
- The dashboard also renders two historical trend charts:
  - **ENNU LIFE SCORE History**
  - **BMI Over Time**

#### **2.2 Post-Assessment Results Pages**

After a user submits any assessment, they are redirected to a unique results page. These pages are designed to provide a beautiful, one-time summary of their performance.

**Generic Fallback:** `[ennu-assessment-results]`
- This shortcode is primarily a fallback
- The system will always try to redirect to a specific results page first

**Specific Results Pages:**
- `[ennu-hair-results]`
- `[ennu-ed-results]`
- `[ennu-skin-results]`
- `[ennu-sleep-results]`
- `[ennu-hormone-results]`
- `[ennu-menopause-results]`
- `[ennu-testosterone-results]`
- `[ennu-weight-loss-results]`

**Behavior:**
- These pages are accessed via a secure, one-time-use token in the URL immediately after an assessment is completed
- They display a "Bio-Metric Canvas" style summary of the user's score for the assessment they just took
- They provide three clear next steps:
  - "View Assessment Results" (links to the permanent "Health Dossier")
  - "View My ENNU LIFE Dashboard"
  - "Take Test Again"
- If a user tries to access the URL after the token has been used, it will gracefully inform them that the link has expired and direct them to their main dashboard

### **3. DETAILED RESULTS PAGE SHORTCODES (The Health Dossier)**

These shortcodes are used on dedicated pages to display the full, permanent results for a specific assessment. These are the pages linked to from the `[ennu-user-dashboard]` and the post-assessment results summary.

**Available Shortcodes:**
- `[ennu-hair-assessment-details]`
- `[ennu-ed-treatment-assessment-details]`
- `[ennu-skin-assessment-details]`
- `[ennu-sleep-assessment-details]`
- `[ennu-hormone-assessment-details]`
- `[ennu-menopause-assessment-details]`
- `[ennu-testosterone-assessment-details]`
- `[ennu-weight-loss-assessment-details]`

**Renders:** A comprehensive, visually rich "Health Dossier" for the specified assessment, styled to match the "Bio-Metric Canvas" aesthetic

**Behavior:**
- Grants access to logged-in users to view their own data at any time
- Also grants temporary, one-time access to guest users who have just completed an assessment and arrive with a valid `results_token`
- Requires a login for any subsequent views
- Displays a historical score timeline, a breakdown of scores by category, and other personalized data visualizations
