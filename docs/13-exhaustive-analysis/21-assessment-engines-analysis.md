## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

This analysis covers the four-engine scoring symphony that powers the ENNU Life Assessments plugin. The system consists of four distinct engines that work together to create a comprehensive, nuanced health assessment: the Quantitative Engine (Potential), Qualitative Engine (Reality), Objective Engine (Actuality), and Intentionality Engine (Alignment).

## **ENGINE ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **Engine Types**

1. **Intentionality Goals Engine**
   - **Purpose:** Handles goal-setting and intentionality assessment logic
   - **Key Features:** Goal prioritization, progress tracking, motivation analysis
   - **Role:** Provides "Alignment Boost" to reward user focus on stated goals

2. **Objective Biomarkers Engine**
   - **Purpose:** Processes quantitative biomarker data
   - **Key Features:** Data validation, trend analysis, threshold monitoring
   - **Role:** Applies "Actuality Adjustment" based on hard biomarker data

3. **Qualitative Symptoms Engine**
   - **Purpose:** Analyzes subjective symptom reports
   - **Key Features:** Symptom correlation, severity assessment, pattern recognition
   - **Role:** Applies "Pillar Integrity Penalty" based on symptom severity

### **Engine Architecture Pattern**

All engines follow a consistent architecture pattern:
- **Input Processing:** Validates and normalizes incoming data
- **Analysis Layer:** Applies business logic and scoring algorithms
- **Output Generation:** Produces structured results and recommendations
- **Integration Interface:** Connects with other system components

### **Integration Points**

- **Scoring System:** All engines feed into the central scoring calculator
- **Recommendation Engine:** Results influence personalized recommendations
- **Dashboard:** Engine outputs are displayed in user dashboards
- **Reporting:** Engine data contributes to comprehensive health reports

## **ENGINE 1: INTENTIONALITY GOALS ENGINE**

### **Overview: The "Alignment Boost" System**

The Intentionality Engine is the fourth and final engine in the ENNU Life scoring symphony. Its purpose is to provide the final, crucial layer of personalization by rewarding a user's focused intent.

**Core Question:** "How is the user's health aligned with their own stated goals?"

### **Core Components**

#### **2.1 Health Goal Data Input**
- **Source:** User's health goals selected in Welcome Assessment and General Health Assessment
- **Storage:** `ennu_global_health_goals` user meta field
- **Format:** Array of selected health goals

#### **2.2 The Goal-to-Pillar Map**
- **Location:** `includes/config/health-optimization-mappings.php`
- **Purpose:** Direct link between each health goal and the primary Health Pillar it affects

**Example Goal-to-Pillar Map:**
| Health Goal | Pillar Boosted |
|-------------|----------------|
| `lose_weight` | Lifestyle |
| `sharpen_focus` | Mind |
| `build_muscle` | Body |
| `improve_sleep` | Lifestyle |
| `balance_hormones` | Body |
| `boost_libido` | Mind |

### **Calculation Flow**

**Method:** `calculate_goal_alignment_boost()` in `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring` class

**Process:**
1. **Receive Adjusted Pillar Scores:** After Qualitative and Objective engine modifications
2. **Fetch User's Goals:** Retrieve `health_goals` array from user meta
3. **Apply Non-Cumulative Boost:** 
   - Iterate through user's goals
   - Apply +5% Alignment Boost to corresponding Pillar
   - **Non-cumulative:** Multiple goals mapping to same Pillar only get one boost
4. **Return Final Pillar Scores:** Used for ultimate ENNU LIFE SCORE calculation

**Example:** Body score 6.1 + "Build muscle" goal = 6.4 (6.1 * 1.05)

## **ENGINE 2: OBJECTIVE BIOMARKERS ENGINE**

### **Overview: The "Actuality Adjustment" System**

The Objective Engine is the third engine in the ENNU Life four-part scoring symphony. Its purpose is to take the user's hard, scientific biomarker data and use it to apply the final, most authoritative adjustments to their Pillar Scores.

**Core Question:** "What is *really* happening inside my body?"

### **Core Components**

#### **2.1 Biomarker Data Input**
- **Source:** ENNU LIFE MEMBERSHIP lab test results
- **Scope:** Over 100 biomarkers
- **Storage:** User profile database

#### **2.2 The Master Biomarker Profile Map**
- **Location:** `includes/config/health-optimization-mappings.php`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive mapping for every biomarker with scoring logic

**Example Biomarker Profile:**
```json
"LDL_Cholesterol": {
  "name": "LDL Cholesterol",
  "units": "mg/dL",
  "optimal_range": [0, 99],
  "suboptimal_range": [100, 159],
  "poor_range": [160, 1000],
  "pillar_impact": {
    "Body": 0.8,
    "Lifestyle": 0.2
  },
  "impact_weight": "critical"
}
```

**Profile Components:**
- **Ranges:** Precise boundaries for optimal, sub-optimal, and poor results
- **Pillar Impact:** Which Pillar(s) affected and by what proportion
- **Impact Weight:** Qualitative descriptor (critical, significant, moderate)

### **Calculation Flow**

**Method:** `calculate_biomarker_actuality_adjustments()` in `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring` class

**Process:**
1. **Receive Biomarker Data:** Complete set of lab results
2. **Iterate and Analyze:** Compare each biomarker to its profile
3. **Calculate Adjustments:**
   - **Negative Adjustments:** Sub-optimal or poor range biomarkers
     - Critical biomarker in poor range: -15% adjustment
     - Moderate biomarker in sub-optimal range: -5% adjustment
   - **Positive Adjustments:** Optimal range biomarkers
     - Small positive adjustment: +2.5% or +5%
   - **Cumulative Application:** Unlike symptoms, biomarker adjustments are cumulative
4. **Return Adjustment Array:** Final multipliers for each pillar

**Example Output:** `['Mind' => 1.05, 'Body' => 0.75, 'Lifestyle' => 0.9, 'Aesthetics' => 1.0]`

## **ENGINE 3: QUALITATIVE SYMPTOMS ENGINE**

### **Overview: The "Pillar Integrity" System**

The Qualitative Engine is the second engine in the ENNU Life four-part scoring symphony. Its purpose is to assess a user's current health *reality* based on their self-reported symptoms and to apply an intelligent, targeted penalty to their quantitative Pillar Scores.

**Core Question:** "What is the user's current health reality based on symptoms?"

### **Core Components**

#### **2.1 The "Health Optimization" Assessment**
- **Type:** 25-question assessment
- **Format:** User selects all symptoms they are experiencing
- **Flag:** `'assessment_engine' => 'qualitative'` for proper processing

#### **2.2 Symptom-to-Category Mapping**
- **Location:** `includes/config/health-optimization-mappings.php`
- **Purpose:** Maps 52 symptoms to eight "Health Optimization" categories

**Example:** `'Erectile Dysfunction'` maps to `['Hormones', 'Heart Health', 'Libido']`

#### **2.3 Category Severity Tiers & Pillar Impact**

| Symptom Category | Severity Tier | Pillar Impacted | Penalty Value |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Heart Health** | **Critical** | **Body** | **-20%** |
| **Cognitive Health** | **Critical** | **Mind** | **-20%** |
| **Hormones** | Moderate | **Body** | -10% |
| **Weight Loss** | Moderate | **Lifestyle** | -10% |
| **Strength** | Moderate | **Body** | -10% |
| **Longevity** | Moderate | **Lifestyle** | -10% |
| **Energy** | Minor | **Lifestyle** | -5% |
| **Libido** | Minor | **Mind** | -5% |

### **Calculation Flow**

**Method:** `calculate_pillar_integrity_penalties()` in `ENNU_Assessment_Scoring` class

**Process:**
1. **Receive Symptoms:** List of symptoms selected by user
2. **Identify Triggered Categories:** Compile unique list of triggered Health Optimization categories
3. **Determine Highest Severity per Pillar:** Find highest severity level for each Pillar
4. **Apply Single Penalty per Pillar:** Only one penalty per pillar (highest severity)
5. **Return Penalty Array:** Multipliers to apply to baseline Pillar Scores

**Example Output:** `['Mind' => 1.0, 'Body' => 0.80, 'Lifestyle' => 1.0, 'Aesthetics' => 1.0]`

## **ENGINE 4: QUANTITATIVE ENGINE**

### **Overview: The "Potential" System**

The Quantitative Engine is the first engine in the ENNU Life scoring symphony. Its purpose is to calculate a user's *potential* for health based on self-reported history and lifestyle.

**Core Question:** "What is the user's health potential based on their lifestyle and history?"

### **Core Components**

- **10 Quantitative Assessments:** Hair, ED Treatment, Weight Loss, Health, Skin, Sleep, Hormone, Menopause, Testosterone
- **Scoring Categories:** Each assessment has 5-10 scoring categories
- **Point Values:** 1-9 point scale with higher values indicating better health
- **Category Weights:** Different categories have different weights in final scoring
