# ENNU Life Assessments - Audit Protocol

This document contains the official protocol for conducting a comprehensive audit of all assessment configuration files. It must be followed with vigorous and aggressive prejudice before any new feature or refactoring can be considered complete.

---

### **The Audit Questions**

For each assessment file, one at a time, the following questions must be answered in the affirmative:

1.  **Quantity and Sufficiency:**
    *   What is the exact amount of questions?
    *   Is this a sufficient number of questions to provide a comprehensive and valuable evaluation (our standard is a minimum of 10)?

2.  **Technical Configuration:**
    *   Do the questions and their answers have their configurations fully set up (e.g., `type`, `options`, `scoring`, `required`, `global_key`)?
    *   Is everything calculable and working? Is every scorable answer option correctly mapped in the `scoring` array?

3.  **Holistic Impact:**
    *   Does the assessment make an impact on all four pillars (Mind, Body, Lifestyle, Aesthetics), or is its limited scope justified and documented?

4.  **Content and User Experience:**
    *   Has every single line of code and configuration been vigorously scrutinized and aggressively audited with prejudice for inadequate, insufficient, or incoherent instances and inconsistencies?
    *   Have all the questions been validated to ensure they read properly and make sense to a front-end user?
    *   Have all the answers been validated to ensure they read perfectly well, are written in natural language, and provide a sufficient range of options for a user to answer in any direction?
