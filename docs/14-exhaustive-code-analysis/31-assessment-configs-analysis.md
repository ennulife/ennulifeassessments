## Security Considerations

Based on the research from [PHP Classes security article](https://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/206-Using-Grep-to-Find-Security-Vulnerabilities-in-PHP-code.html), these assessment configuration files represent several security concerns:

1. **Direct Access Vulnerability**: Configurations can be accessed directly without authentication
2. **Personal Data Exposure**: Contains demographic and health data structures
3. **No Input Validation**: Configurations loaded without validation
4. **Information Disclosure**: Contains assessment logic and scoring calculations

The files should implement proper access controls, input validation, and consider encryption for sensitive assessment data to align with security best practices for PHP applications and personal data protection requirements.
