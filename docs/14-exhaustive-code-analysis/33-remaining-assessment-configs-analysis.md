## Security Considerations

Based on the research from [PHP Classes security article](https://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/206-Using-Grep-to-Find-Security-Vulnerabilities-in-PHP-code.html) and [ConfigAnalyser](https://github.com/tanveerdar/ConfigAnalyser), these assessment configuration files represent several security concerns:

1. **Direct Access Vulnerability**: Configurations can be accessed directly without authentication
2. **Personal Data Exposure**: Contains health, medical, and demographic data structures
3. **No Input Validation**: Configurations loaded without validation
4. **Information Disclosure**: Contains assessment logic and scoring calculations

The files should implement proper access controls, input validation, and consider encryption for sensitive assessment data to align with security best practices for PHP applications and personal data protection requirements.

## Configuration Analysis Insights

Based on the [GetPageSpeed NGINX Configuration Check](https://www.getpagespeed.com/check-nginx-config) and [Cisco Config Checks](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/wireless-troubleshooting-tools/config-checks-and-messages/) methodologies, these assessment configurations would benefit from:

1. **Configuration Validation**: Automated schema validation for assessment structures
2. **Security Scanning**: Detection of sensitive data exposure in configurations
3. **Performance Analysis**: Optimization of large configuration arrays
4. **Compliance Checking**: Verification against data protection requirements
