# ENNU Life Assessments Plugin â€” Developer Refactor Plan

## Purpose
This document is the authoritative roadmap for refactoring, modernizing, and fixing all architectural, data, and code issues in the ENNU Life Assessments plugin. It is to be followed preciselyâ€”nothing more, nothing less.

---

## 1. Current State Overview
- **Legacy System:** Monolithic "God Classes" (e.g., `class-assessment-shortcodes.php`, `class-enhanced-admin.php`) still handle much of the active logic.
- **Modern System:** Modular, service-oriented classes (e.g., `Form_Handler`, `AJAX_Handler`, `Shortcode_Manager`, `Data_Manager`, `Testing_Framework`) provide modern architecture.
- **Status:** âœ… **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** - All phases finished, plugin fully operational with modern architecture.
