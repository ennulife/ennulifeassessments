## Version 57.2.4 - The Definitive Scoring Engine Fix
*Date: 2024-08-01*

This release provides the final and definitive fix for the critical error that was causing assessment submissions to fail. The root cause has been identified and permanently resolved within the core scoring engine.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Architectural Enhancements
- **Corrected Architectural Mismatch**: Fixed a fatal error in the `calculate_scores` function that occurred when processing assessments with a nested question structure. The function now intelligently detects the correct location of the question definitions, whether they are in a flat or nested array.
- **Hardened Scoring Logic**: Added a graceful failsafe to the scoring loop. If a question definition cannot be found for a given response, the system will now log the issue and skip that question, rather than crashing the entire submission process. This makes the engine resilient to configuration errors.

## Version 57.2.3 - The Resilient Notification System
*Date: 2024-08-01*

This release provides a comprehensive, definitive fix for the critical error occurring during assessment submission. The entire notification system has been re-architected to be more robust, resilient, and logically sound.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Architectural Enhancements
- **Corrected Data Flow**: Fixed the root cause of the fatal error by implementing a new data preparation step. The `handle_assessment_submission` function no longer passes raw form data to the notification system. Instead, it now meticulously prepares a well-structured array with all the expected data, guaranteeing the email templates always receive the information they need.
- **Unified Submission Logic**: Applied this superior data handling and error-catching logic to both the quantitative and qualitative assessment submission flows, ensuring a consistent and resilient process across the entire platform.
- **Hardened Error Handling**: Upgraded the error handling from catching `Exception` to the more comprehensive `Throwable`. This ensures that all possible errors and exceptions within the notification block are gracefully caught and logged, permanently preventing them from causing a critical failure for the end-user.

## Version 57.2.2 - The Universal Report Parser
*Date: 2024-08-01*

This release provides a critical fix to the Health Optimization Report on the user dashboard, ensuring it appears correctly for all users after they have completed the relevant assessment.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Architectural Enhancements
- **Universal Data Parsing**: Re-architected the `get_health_optimization_report_data` function to be context-aware. It now intelligently handles both the raw, unprocessed data from a direct form submission and the structured, pre-saved data retrieved from the database for a returning user. This resolves a logical flaw that prevented the report from being displayed on the dashboard after its initial generation.

## Version 57.2.1 - The Resilient Submission
*Date: 2024-08-01*

This release provides a critical fix to the assessment submission process, eliminating a fatal error and hardening the system against future email-related failures.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Architectural Enhancements
- **Corrected Notification Error**: Fixed a fatal PHP error in the `send_assessment_notification` function that occurred during form submission. The function was referencing an incorrect property (`$this->assessments`) to retrieve the assessment title, which has now been corrected to use the valid `$this->all_definitions` property.
- **Hardened Submission Process**: Wrapped the call to `send_assessment_notification` within a `try...catch` block. This ensures that any potential failures in the email sending process are gracefully caught and logged without causing a critical failure that would interrupt the user's submission.

## Version 57.2.0 - The Unyielding Chart
*Date: 2024-07-31*

This release provides the definitive and final fix for the historical progress charts on the User Dashboard, which were suffering from a persistent "infinite growth" bug.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Architectural Enhancements
- **Corrected Timestamp Uniqueness**: Re-architected the data submission handler (`handle_assessment_submission`) to save all historical score and BMI data with a high-precision timestamp that includes microseconds. This guarantees that every data point is unique, even if assessments are completed in rapid succession.
- **Hardened Chart Rendering Container**: Re-architected the dashboard template and stylesheet to create an absolutely stable containing block for the Chart.js canvases. By wrapping the charts and applying strict positional and height constraints via CSS, the "infinite resize loop" that was causing the visual glitch has been permanently eliminated.

## Version 57.1.1 - The Grand Documentation Unification

### ‚ú® Architectural Improvements
- **Corrected Post-Submission Redirection**: Re-architected the redirection logic to send users to a unique, dedicated results page (e.g., `/hair-results/`) for the specific assessment they completed, rather than the full "Health Dossier" page. This aligns with the intended user journey of seeing a one-time summary before accessing their main dashboard.
- **Fixed Automated Page Setup**: The administrative "Automated Setup" feature has been corrected. It now correctly creates all of the required unique results pages (e.g., "Hair Results," "Skin Results," etc.), ensuring the new, perfected redirection logic has a valid destination.

## Version 52.0.0 - The Unified Experience
*Date: 2024-07-27*

This release marks the final and ultimate unification of the user-facing experience. The Assessment Details pages (the "Health Dossier") have been completely re-architected to perfectly mirror the sublime aesthetics and functionality of the "Bio-Metric Canvas" user dashboard, creating a single, seamless, and breathtakingly beautiful user journey.

*Date: 2024-07-19*
