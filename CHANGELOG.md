### üîí Security Fixes

- **Standardized AJAX Nonces**: Corrected inconsistent AJAX nonce handling between the frontend and backend to ensure all AJAX requests are properly secured.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Performance
- **Fixed Activation Bug**: Repaired the plugin activation hook to ensure that the necessary database tables are correctly created on installation.
- **Resolved Duplicate Initialization**: Removed a redundant call that was causing the entire plugin to load twice, which could lead to unpredictable behavior.
- **Fixed Performance Bottleneck**: Disabled a feature that was writing a large security log to the `wp_options` table, preventing database bloat and improving site-wide performance.
- **Cleaned Up Dead Code**: Removed multiple unused AJAX hooks and unnecessary function polyfills to streamline the codebase.
- **Decoupled WooCommerce Data**: Removed the hardcoded product list from the WooCommerce integration class, encouraging the standard practice of managing products in the WordPress admin.

## Version 24.10.1

## [26.0.38] - 2024-10-02
### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed a fatal error (`Call to undefined method`) on the Health Dossier page. The `get_health_pillar_map()` function was missing from the scoring class and has now been implemented, and the template has been corrected to call the right function. The Health Quad-Pillars now display correctly.

## [26.0.39] - 2024-10-02

## [26.0.40] - 2024-10-02
### Changed
- **Architecture**: Implemented a new, universal system for global data persistence. Any question marked with a `global_key` is now automatically saved and pre-filled across all assessments.
### Fixed
