```php
foreach ( $user_assessments as $assessment_key => $assessment_data ) {
    if ( ! empty( $assessment_data['completed'] ) && ! empty( $assessment_data['categories'] ) ) {
        foreach ( $assessment_data['categories'] as $category => $score ) {
            if ( $score < 6 ) {
                // Generate symptoms for low scores
                $symptoms_for_category = get_symptoms_for_category( $category );
            } elseif ( $score < 7 ) {
                // Generate mild symptoms for moderate scores
                $mild_symptoms = get_mild_symptoms_for_category( $category );
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Category-Symptom Mapping:**
- **Energy**: fatigue, low_energy, tiredness

- **Score Display**: Health Optimization Assessment now shows "Qualitative Analysis" instead of numerical score
- **Dashboard Integration**: Proper handling of qualitative vs quantitative assessments
- **Data Flow**: Corrected the complete assessment processing flow from A to Z

#### **Understanding the Complete Flow**
- **Standard Assessments**: Use Quantitative Engine ‚Üí Generate numerical scores (7.5, 8.2, etc.)
- **Health Optimization**: Uses Qualitative Engine ‚Üí Generates symptom analysis and biomarker recommendations
- **Different Processing**: Health Optimization uses `ENNU_Health_Optimization_Calculator` for symptom analysis
- **No Numerical Scores**: Health Optimization Assessment is designed for symptom analysis, not scoring

- **Score Calculation**: Fixed issue where ENNU Life Score was always returning 0 due to weight lookup failures
- **System Accuracy**: Restored proper scoring calculations for all health assessments

#### **Technical Details**
- **Root Cause**: Pillar names from `PillarScoreCalculator` were capitalized (Mind, Body, Lifestyle, Aesthetics) but weights were defined in lowercase
- **Impact**: `isset( $weights[ $pillar_name ] )` always returned false, resulting in zero score calculations
- **Fix**: Updated weight array keys to match actual pillar names: `'Mind'`, `'Body'`, `'Lifestyle'`, `'Aesthetics'`
- **Result**: Proper weight application and accurate ENNU Life Score calculations

- **Score Calculation**: Fixed issue where final ENNU Life Score was returning 0 due to missing `$all_definitions` parameter
- **Logging Safety**: Enhanced error logging with proper array checks to prevent null access errors

#### **Technical Details**
- **Root Cause**: Constructor expected `$all_definitions` as 3rd parameter but received `$health_goals`
- **Impact**: This caused health optimization calculations to fail, resulting in incorrect scores
- **Fix**: Corrected parameter order: `new ENNU_Life_Score_Calculator( $user_id, $final_pillar_scores, $all_definitions, $health_goals, $goal_definitions )`
- **Safety**: Added `is_array()` and `isset()` checks for all array access operations

#### **User Experience Impact**
- **Before**: Scores showing 0 or incorrect values, PHP warnings in logs
- **After**: Proper score calculations with accurate health assessment results
- **Reliability**: Eliminated scoring system crashes and calculation failures

### üéØ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**
- **Scoring System**: Parameter mismatch resolved ‚úÖ
- **Error Handling**: Null access errors eliminated ‚úÖ

## Version 57.2.4 - The Definitive Scoring Engine Fix
*Date: 2024-08-01*

This release provides the final and definitive fix for the critical error that was causing assessment submissions to fail. The root cause has been identified and permanently resolved within the core scoring engine.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Architectural Enhancements
- **Corrected Architectural Mismatch**: Fixed a fatal error in the `calculate_scores` function that occurred when processing assessments with a nested question structure. The function now intelligently detects the correct location of the question definitions, whether they are in a flat or nested array.
- **Hardened Scoring Logic**: Added a graceful failsafe to the scoring loop. If a question definition cannot be found for a given response, the system will now log the issue and skip that question, rather than crashing the entire submission process. This makes the engine resilient to configuration errors.

## Version 57.2.3 - The Resilient Notification System
*Date: 2024-08-01*

This release provides a comprehensive, definitive fix for the critical error occurring during assessment submission. The entire notification system has been re-architected to be more robust, resilient, and logically sound.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Architectural Enhancements
- **Corrected Data Flow**: Fixed the root cause of the fatal error by implementing a new data preparation step. The `handle_assessment_submission` function no longer passes raw form data to the notification system. Instead, it now meticulously prepares a well-structured array with all the expected data, guaranteeing the email templates always receive the information they need.
- **Unified Submission Logic**: Applied this superior data handling and error-catching logic to both the quantitative and qualitative assessment submission flows, ensuring a consistent and resilient process across the entire platform.
- **Hardened Error Handling**: Upgraded the error handling from catching `Exception` to the more comprehensive `Throwable`. This ensures that all possible errors and exceptions within the notification block are gracefully caught and logged without causing a critical failure for the end-user.

## Version 57.2.2 - The Universal Report Parser
*Date: 2024-08-01*

This release provides a critical fix to the Health Optimization Report on the user dashboard, ensuring it appears correctly for all users after they have completed the relevant assessment.

### üêõ Bug Fixes & Architectural Enhancements
- **Universal Data Parsing**: Re-architected the `get_health_optimization_report_data` function to be context-aware.
