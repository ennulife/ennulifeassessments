## ðŸŽ¯ Research Focus
Hormonal health, metabolic optimization, endocrine disorders

## ðŸ“Š Assigned Biomarkers
- **Glucose** - Blood sugar regulation and metabolic health
- **HbA1c** - Long-term blood sugar control and diabetes risk
- **Testosterone** - Male and female hormonal health
- **Cortisol** - Stress hormone and adrenal function
- **Vitamin D** - Hormone-like vitamin with multiple functions
- **Insulin** - Blood sugar regulation and metabolic health
- **TSH** - Thyroid stimulating hormone
- **T3** - Triiodothyronine (active thyroid hormone)
- **T4** - Thyroxine (thyroid hormone)

## ðŸ”¬ Research Process

### Phase 1: Literature Review (Day 1)
1. **Current Clinical Guidelines Review**
   - American Diabetes Association (ADA) - Glucose, HbA1c, Insulin
   - Endocrine Society - Testosterone, Cortisol, Thyroid hormones
   - American Thyroid Association - TSH, T3, T4
   - Vitamin D Council - Vitamin D guidelines

2. **Peer-Reviewed Literature Search**
   - PubMed search for each biomarker (last 5 years)
   - Focus on randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews
   - Identify age/gender-specific variations

3. **Evidence Assessment**
   - Evaluate evidence quality using GRADE criteria
   - Assess clinical relevance and applicability
   - Identify gaps in current knowledge

### Phase 2: Reference Range Validation (Day 2-3)
1. **Optimal Range Establishment**
   - Define optimal ranges for each biomarker
   - Consider age and gender variations
   - Account for population differences

2. **Suboptimal and Poor Range Definition**
   - Establish suboptimal ranges (borderline values)
   - Define poor ranges (clearly abnormal values)
   - Document clinical significance of each range

3. **Safety Protocol Development**
   - Identify contraindications for testing
   - Document risk factors and safety limits
   - Establish emergency protocols if needed

### Phase 3: Clinical Context Documentation (Day 4)
1. **Clinical Significance**
   - Explain what each biomarker measures
   - Document clinical implications of abnormal values
   - Provide context for interpretation

2. **Age/Gender Variations**
   - Document age-specific reference ranges
   - Identify gender-specific considerations
   - Note lifecycle variations (puberty, pregnancy, menopause)

3. **Lifestyle and Environmental Factors**
   - Document lifestyle factors affecting levels
   - Note seasonal variations (especially Vitamin D)
   - Identify medication interactions

### Phase 4: Cross-Validation (Day 5)
1. **Peer Review**
   - Submit research for review by other specialists
   - Address feedback and concerns
   - Resolve any conflicts or disagreements

2. **Clinical Validation**
   - Validate against current clinical guidelines
   - Ensure alignment with best practices
   - Confirm safety and accuracy
