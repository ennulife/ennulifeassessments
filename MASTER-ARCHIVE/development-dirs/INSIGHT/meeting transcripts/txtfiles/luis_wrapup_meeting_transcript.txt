0:3:1.574 --> 0:3:2.294
Basement
Jim reevesa.
0:3:26.64 --> 0:3:26.664
Basement
Happened about.
0:3:44.704 --> 0:3:45.104
Basement
No.
0:4:27.434 --> 0:4:28.234
Basement
I'll charge it down here.
0:4:33.24 --> 0:4:34.344
Basement
Dagen, you look great today, dude.
0:4:37.434 --> 0:4:38.394
Basement
Your mic's off.
0:4:38.394 --> 0:4:40.954
Basement
No one can hear you, but rookie just leave it at that.
0:4:43.494 --> 0:4:44.454
Kegan Wesley
Thank you very much.
0:4:44.454 --> 0:4:47.94
Kegan Wesley
I appreciate the sweet compliments today. I needed to hear that.
0:4:48.634 --> 0:4:48.754
Basement
Hmm.
0:4:52.734 --> 0:4:54.694
Basement
What is that plant behind you?
0:4:55.504 --> 0:4:56.104
Kegan Wesley
I don't know.
0:4:56.104 --> 0:4:58.264
Kegan Wesley
It's it's Jake and his 4000 plants.
0:4:58.264 --> 0:5:1.184
Kegan Wesley
I just got home like 10-5 minutes ago.
0:5:3.834 --> 0:5:5.714
Kegan Wesley
Like falling out of the pot.
0:5:5.714 --> 0:5:6.234
Kegan Wesley
I tried to.
0:5:8.974 --> 0:5:12.494
Kegan Wesley
I try to secretly throw some away some time, especially the ones that are out there.
0:5:15.14 --> 0:5:15.414
Kegan Wesley
Here.
0:5:18.714 --> 0:5:20.354
Kegan Wesley
Are we the only ones in here right now?
0:5:21.324 --> 0:5:22.964
Basement
Yeah, Louis should be joining, but.
0:5:25.684 --> 0:5:28.884
Basement
That I'm assuming you discussed this meeting time with him.
0:5:32.524 --> 0:5:32.764
Kegan Wesley
Huh.
0:5:34.304 --> 0:5:36.504
Ted Ennenbach
Who's actually proposed by him?
0:5:37.344 --> 0:5:37.424
Basement
Up.
0:5:38.504 --> 0:5:38.664
Basement
Good.
0:5:59.594 --> 0:6:3.714
Kegan Wesley
Hey Trent. Did the kids or whatever you were sitting to Front Creek, did they go there yet?
0:6:5.764 --> 0:6:6.684
Basement
Yes.
0:6:7.204 --> 0:6:7.564
Kegan Wesley
OK.
0:6:9.744 --> 0:6:11.664
Kegan Wesley
I have a bunch of stuff I have to take their own Monday.
0:6:11.784 --> 0:6:12.584
Kegan Wesley
That's why I was asking.
0:6:14.464 --> 0:6:20.104
Basement
If you're coming by here, get with me first, just in case I need to send more there.
0:6:21.4 --> 0:6:21.324
Kegan Wesley
OK.
0:6:22.684 --> 0:6:26.124
Basement
But I don't think that's very unlikely, to be honest.
0:6:26.124 --> 0:6:27.844
Basement
But Don'll make a trip.
0:6:27.214 --> 0:6:27.774
Kegan Wesley
OK.
0:6:27.844 --> 0:6:29.164
Basement
Don't make a trip here.
0:6:30.894 --> 0:6:40.294
Kegan Wesley
OK, I have a meeting with the Botox Rep Monday morning, so I might just meet him over like Highlands area and then go.
0:6:42.434 --> 0:6:43.154
Kegan Wesley
That's scary.
0:6:43.194 --> 0:6:44.634
Kegan Wesley
Who? How is that your camera?
0:6:46.64 --> 0:6:51.544
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah. So that's the guy cleaning the window on the 30th floor.
0:6:53.74 --> 0:6:57.834
Ted Ennenbach
I I look out this morning and I'm like, thinking I love my job.
0:6:58.74 --> 0:6:58.674
Ted Ennenbach
Like what?
0:6:58.674 --> 0:7:2.274
Ted Ennenbach
Whatever I'm doing in the world compared to what he's doing.
0:7:3.914 --> 0:7:5.634
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, he's held like 2 ropes.
0:7:7.24 --> 0:7:8.904
Ted Ennenbach
And clean the third floor.
0:7:11.294 --> 0:7:11.854
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:7:14.404 --> 0:7:15.4
Luis Escobar
Hey, guys.
0:7:16.604 --> 0:7:17.324
Basement
Hey there.
0:7:17.444 --> 0:7:18.164
Basement
How we doing?
0:7:17.834 --> 0:7:18.994
Luis Escobar
I've got good, good.
0:7:18.994 --> 0:7:19.674
Luis Escobar
How are you guys?
0:7:19.14 --> 0:7:19.174
Kegan Wesley
OK.
0:7:21.134 --> 0:7:22.774
Basement
Good, good.
0:7:31.854 --> 0:7:33.774
Luis Escobar
Alright. Is everyone here? Should we start?
0:7:35.874 --> 0:7:39.594
Luis Escobar
All right. So yeah, let's just get right into it.
0:7:41.674 --> 0:7:44.394
Luis Escobar
First week for me was quite a lot of.
0:7:46.394 --> 0:7:47.714
Luis Escobar
Digging to say at least.
0:7:47.714 --> 0:7:54.594
Luis Escobar
Just trying to wrap my head around, you know, all the data, all the content and and just the overall strategy, right?
0:7:59.4 --> 0:8:7.84
Luis Escobar
I I spoke with Ted earlier today and I thought there was three major points that we should discuss today, and that's one being the data, the data.
0:8:8.514 --> 0:8:17.74
Luis Escobar
Migration and then also the I shared some links on the lead magnet for the website, right?
0:8:19.274 --> 0:8:27.714
Luis Escobar
And then lastly, also going over just now the sprints that are that are ahead of us from from where we stand right now?
0:8:31.174 --> 0:8:36.534
Luis Escobar
Have you guys had a chance to take a look at the e-mail I sent regarding the data migration?
0:8:39.244 --> 0:8:42.764
Basement
Kind of skimmed over it, but didn't have time to digest the whole thing.
0:8:39.804 --> 0:8:40.124
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:8:44.274 --> 0:8:44.554
Basement
But yeah.
0:8:45.334 --> 0:8:46.574
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yeah, same here.
0:8:48.754 --> 0:8:49.674
Luis Escobar
Let me just pull it up.
0:9:38.834 --> 0:9:40.474
Luis Escobar
My camera is not screen showing.
0:9:43.64 --> 0:9:43.744
Basement
Yes.
0:9:43.134 --> 0:9:43.294
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:9:44.64 --> 0:9:44.504
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:9:51.24 --> 0:9:53.224
Luis Escobar
Yeah. So what?
0:9:53.304 --> 0:10:0.624
Luis Escobar
What this document is laying out is basically a guideline on how we should do a one to one migration, right?
0:10:2.114 --> 0:10:6.194
Luis Escobar
Specifically, with all the different field names, right?
0:10:8.304 --> 0:10:11.184
Luis Escobar
I it's quite meticulous, All in all.
0:10:12.834 --> 0:10:16.274
Luis Escobar
This thing is telling us it's gonna generate about 165 fields.
0:10:16.634 --> 0:10:22.674
Luis Escobar
It derived that based on the research it did on 16,000,000 records that we got from that export.
0:10:29.514 --> 0:10:35.434
Luis Escobar
In HubSpot, we're going to be making use of these 7 standard objects that already exist there, right?
0:10:35.434 --> 0:10:44.474
Luis Escobar
We're just going to be enhancing them with all these new fields and then we're going to go ahead and also create 3 new custom objects to basically serve our our purpose.
0:10:46.324 --> 0:10:49.604
Luis Escobar
Once we have all these fields inside of HubSpot.
0:10:51.194 --> 0:10:54.954
Luis Escobar
Then we can pull the trigger on a on a full bulk import.
0:11:1.594 --> 0:11:7.34
Luis Escobar
I'm wondering if what are your guys thoughts on this so far?
0:11:9.104 --> 0:11:17.184
Ted Ennenbach
The only thing that would not make it exhaustive or inclusive of everything are records stored in mind body.
0:11:17.184 --> 0:11:21.544
Ted Ennenbach
So we have to have a mind body down download, export.
0:11:23.754 --> 0:11:24.274
Luis Escobar
Got it.
0:11:24.474 --> 0:11:24.754
Luis Escobar
And.
0:11:24.694 --> 0:11:34.574
Basement
I have a mind body developer key I can share with you or they also have the option I think to like provide a full export for like $500.
0:11:37.44 --> 0:11:37.684
Luis Escobar
Got it.
0:11:37.924 --> 0:11:40.84
Luis Escobar
I mean, they probably offer that for.
0:11:38.134 --> 0:11:43.534
Basement
But if you if you just need the fields too, we we we did an export at one time in the past.
0:11:43.534 --> 0:11:45.414
Basement
So I have that still.
0:11:46.544 --> 0:11:52.64
Kegan Wesley
Steven, what was the turn around on that when we ordered the the the data transfer, was it?
0:11:46.684 --> 0:11:47.684
Luis Escobar
It would be.
0:11:52.64 --> 0:11:53.544
Kegan Wesley
Was it a couple weeks or was it fast?
0:11:55.434 --> 0:12:6.994
Basement
I think it was probably three to four days they normally I think they claim within 48 hours, but it took a little while because there was something weird with our account or something. I don't.
0:12:7.684 --> 0:12:7.884
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:12:7.704 --> 0:12:8.104
Kegan Wesley
OK.
0:12:9.64 --> 0:12:10.904
Basement
But only a few days.
0:12:16.714 --> 0:12:17.274
Luis Escobar
That's good.
0:12:19.234 --> 0:12:23.114
Renzo Mogrovejo
Please what are those 3 new custom objects?
0:12:25.624 --> 0:12:27.144
Luis Escobar
The new ones here.
0:12:43.644 --> 0:12:45.684
Luis Escobar
So it's going to be the measurement history.
0:12:47.154 --> 0:12:47.354
Luis Escobar
Telehealth.
0:12:49.114 --> 0:12:50.634
Luis Escobar
And lab results is the other one.
0:12:52.464 --> 0:12:52.944
Renzo Mogrovejo
OK.
0:12:53.304 --> 0:12:54.824
Renzo Mogrovejo
So the appointments.
0:12:53.824 --> 0:12:54.24
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:12:56.554 --> 0:13:2.354
Renzo Mogrovejo
Objects we will have an an appointment or we are going to use.
0:13:3.864 --> 0:13:6.824
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we're gonna make use of the native appointments.
0:13:4.74 --> 0:13:4.554
Renzo Mogrovejo
The the.
0:13:6.944 --> 0:13:8.24
Renzo Mogrovejo
Of the native OK.
0:13:8.424 --> 0:13:12.504
Luis Escobar
Yeah. And that'll serve as our our on location appointments.
0:13:14.64 --> 0:13:14.224
Renzo Mogrovejo
OK.
0:13:15.584 --> 0:13:20.424
Luis Escobar
And then meetings, we'll use that for like any scheduled meetings.
0:13:30.84 --> 0:13:33.484
Luis Escobar
But yeah, it it's it's quite the undertaking.
0:13:33.484 --> 0:13:39.644
Luis Escobar
I'm not gonna lie to to do this properly, but I think with this guideline that we have now in this documentation.
0:13:42.484 --> 0:13:45.804
Luis Escobar
It makes it more tangible really.
0:13:46.84 --> 0:13:49.564
Luis Escobar
You just have to have those fields in place and then everything falls into place.
0:13:55.924 --> 0:14:5.84
Luis Escobar
You know, getting this done really has a big impact on, you know, the next steps right in in regards to like really making the best use of this data.
0:14:5.84 --> 0:14:7.524
Luis Escobar
So I know we want to make this like a top priority.
0:14:13.674 --> 0:14:17.274
Luis Escobar
The biggest obstacle I see right now is just creating all those fields.
0:14:17.314 --> 0:14:19.154
Luis Escobar
I think I mentioned it on the last call.
0:14:20.914 --> 0:14:21.354
Luis Escobar
So.
0:14:23.154 --> 0:14:23.434
Luis Escobar
Is there?
0:14:23.474 --> 0:14:26.274
Luis Escobar
Is there any ideas on how we can approach this?
0:14:26.754 --> 0:14:27.834
Luis Escobar
Normally I would.
0:14:27.874 --> 0:14:35.194
Luis Escobar
You know, I I'd work with like one of my virtual assistants and and then have them do this, you know, legwork.
0:14:35.514 --> 0:14:38.114
Luis Escobar
It'll take probably a couple days to really get it in.
0:14:38.194 --> 0:14:42.514
Luis Escobar
All right, I've looked into some automations to try to get this done.
0:14:43.224 --> 0:14:43.504
Luis Escobar
But.
0:14:45.234 --> 0:14:47.514
Luis Escobar
The HubSpot for some reason doesn't really.
0:14:49.64 --> 0:14:52.384
Luis Escobar
Encourage bulk creation of objects and fields.
0:15:3.434 --> 0:15:4.234
Luis Escobar
But yeah, in short.
0:15:3.644 --> 0:15:5.884
Ted Ennenbach
I'd be concerned.
0:15:4.334 --> 0:15:5.14
Basement
I mean I can.
0:15:6.84 --> 0:15:8.4
Ted Ennenbach
I'd be concerned about the ball.
0:15:10.114 --> 0:15:13.834
Ted Ennenbach
Imports as well, and I think some of it's gonna require.
0:15:13.834 --> 0:15:19.634
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, I mean not one to one, but are you know record by record but I mean.
0:15:21.504 --> 0:15:21.984
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:15:21.514 --> 0:15:30.314
Ted Ennenbach
I think there is some there. I mean some of the nomenclature is gonna be different, especially when you're you're comparing mind body.
0:15:31.994 --> 0:15:32.314
Ted Ennenbach
You know.
0:15:33.914 --> 0:15:34.874
Ted Ennenbach
Put I mean what what they call?
0:15:35.304 --> 0:15:43.464
Ted Ennenbach
One thing there might be called something else, but I would say it would be it would be Steven, Renzo or Xavina.
0:15:39.174 --> 0:15:39.854
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:15:43.504 --> 0:15:47.744
Ted Ennenbach
I would think would be the natural team to work on this.
0:15:49.994 --> 0:15:50.474
Luis Escobar
Gotcha.
0:15:52.214 --> 0:15:53.574
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we're there's gonna be.
0:15:53.574 --> 0:15:59.14
Luis Escobar
Yes, a little bit of just, you know trial and error at the very beginning, right.
0:15:59.214 --> 0:16:0.494
Luis Escobar
Hopefully not too much.
0:16:0.574 --> 0:16:8.654
Luis Escobar
We should be able to nail it down to like just a a few simple templates if you will, and then everything should fall into place.
0:16:8.694 --> 0:16:12.94
Luis Escobar
But let's let's do this in segments. You know I would.
0:16:12.94 --> 0:16:16.934
Luis Escobar
I would recommend prioritizing the highest priority like you know existing Members.
0:16:17.954 --> 0:16:20.754
Luis Escobar
Accounts that were created in the last.
0:16:22.184 --> 0:16:23.104
Luis Escobar
Three years.
0:16:25.304 --> 0:16:27.584
Luis Escobar
And then and then the rest would follow.
0:16:32.624 --> 0:16:37.104
Luis Escobar
As soon as we get at least those last three years in there, I I can already work with that.
0:16:37.104 --> 0:16:39.184
Luis Escobar
You know, we can start making some automations.
0:16:39.184 --> 0:16:44.864
Luis Escobar
We can start working on some follow up sequences and and and nurture sequences.
0:16:50.734 --> 0:16:59.934
Basement
In effort to get things going quick, so we just just focus on the three years and then work work with that or how much longer would it take to do the full thing.
0:16:59.934 --> 0:17:1.774
Basement
I'm I'm so unfamiliar so.
0:17:3.124 --> 0:17:9.564
Luis Escobar
Getting the full thing wouldn't take too much longer compared to the three years, but I think we should prioritize at least those first three years.
0:17:11.154 --> 0:17:11.434
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:17:15.264 --> 0:17:21.544
Luis Escobar
So that's the bulk import side of things and then going forward, there's the continuous sync.
0:17:23.514 --> 0:17:24.474
Luis Escobar
Right, so I kinda wanna.
0:17:27.154 --> 0:17:28.34
Luis Escobar
Pick your brains on.
0:17:28.34 --> 0:17:30.74
Luis Escobar
How do you guys see that going like?
0:17:33.674 --> 0:17:37.234
Luis Escobar
Are we still making use of OM dental?
0:17:40.814 --> 0:17:43.894
Luis Escobar
Or or we eventually phasing that out.
0:17:44.864 --> 0:17:45.944
Basement
Yeah, I mean that.
0:17:45.944 --> 0:17:52.544
Basement
That's certainly an option that we probably could consider, especially with some of these custom objects.
0:17:52.544 --> 0:17:59.744
Basement
I think we could like replace some of the functionality that's kept us in open dental, like the lab and E prescribing.
0:18:0.734 --> 0:18:0.934
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:18:1.234 --> 0:18:3.394
Basement
Yeah, those those.
0:18:4.274 --> 0:18:8.834
Basement
I don't know exactly what it would take to create those. I know that's like a really regulated.
0:18:10.474 --> 0:18:10.794
Basement
That like.
0:18:11.304 --> 0:18:19.904
Basement
Staying, I feel like they're really protective about those features, just in general, not in soap and dental, but.
0:18:21.994 --> 0:18:26.394
Basement
Like E prescribers, I don't like how easy that is to set up or like a lab integration.
0:18:28.114 --> 0:18:31.194
Basement
They're very secure with that information. But yeah, I mean.
0:18:30.614 --> 0:18:31.814
Luis Escobar
That kind of stuff.
0:18:31.814 --> 0:18:34.374
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I would probably not.
0:18:34.774 --> 0:18:37.334
Luis Escobar
You know use a use HubSpot for that.
0:18:37.574 --> 0:18:50.174
Luis Escobar
We could use HubSpot as a as a way of documenting and logging that kind of data, but not necessarily the official platform that that that sends out the prescriptions is that is that what it is?
0:18:50.684 --> 0:18:52.204
Basement
Yeah. OK.
0:18:51.754 --> 0:18:51.914
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:18:53.4 --> 0:19:10.564
Basement
Yeah. I mean, if we could, if we could basically like use open dental for very minimal purposes like, OK, only go in here to do E prescribing or then we can maybe even just find a different solution than open dental at some point for that specific purpose.
0:19:5.904 --> 0:19:6.104
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:19:10.104 --> 0:19:10.304
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:19:12.354 --> 0:19:14.474
Basement
Yeah, I mean that would be that would be great.
0:19:16.234 --> 0:19:19.994
Basement
Kind of like that's kind of been our goal for a long time to solidify.
0:19:17.894 --> 0:19:18.214
Luis Escobar
Got it.
0:19:20.304 --> 0:19:22.464
Basement
It's all this data in one place and.
0:19:25.234 --> 0:19:39.554
Basement
Yeah, I think that will allow Kagan to kind of like move everyone over. I mean, not to open dental, but to this kind of custom HubSpot thing we're building from my body too.
0:19:25.474 --> 0:19:25.834
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:19:39.554 --> 0:19:40.634
Basement
I don't want to speak for him, but.
0:19:42.114 --> 0:19:43.394
Basement
If we basically build everything out.
0:19:44.694 --> 0:19:56.174
Kegan Wesley
Yeah. And then until then, I don't know how you need the like new client data, but I I receive an e-mail from my body of.
0:19:45.284 --> 0:19:45.484
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:19:57.674 --> 0:20:1.154
Kegan Wesley
Their their entire like client profile of that new patient.
0:20:1.154 --> 0:20:5.314
Kegan Wesley
So if we need to redirect that information to someone else or.
0:20:7.794 --> 0:20:15.394
Kegan Wesley
Whoever it would be beneficial to send to for the ongoing data dump of clients that that come see us.
0:20:15.464 --> 0:20:17.504
Kegan Wesley
Yes, through my body I can.
0:20:17.584 --> 0:20:18.264
Kegan Wesley
I can edit that.
0:20:19.724 --> 0:20:22.844
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that'd be great if you can share some of that, that.
0:20:23.164 --> 0:20:24.604
Luis Escobar
So that's good to have.
0:20:25.704 --> 0:20:37.904
Basement
Yeah, our our developer portal access allows for 5000 API calls per month for free too, and then beyond that I think it's like .02 cents per charge per call or something.
0:20:33.514 --> 0:20:33.874
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:20:39.504 --> 0:20:42.944
Luis Escobar
OK, that should be more than enough I hope.
0:20:43.904 --> 0:20:51.344
Kegan Wesley
Do you want me to send an example of the the client profile e-mail or what?
0:20:51.344 --> 0:20:52.264
Kegan Wesley
What are my next steps?
0:20:51.504 --> 0:20:52.464
Luis Escobar
Yeah, please.
0:20:52.904 --> 0:20:59.864
Luis Escobar
Yeah, send the send that example and then the admin access and the API access. That way I can just get my hands on that.
0:21:0.954 --> 0:21:10.354
Kegan Wesley
All right, I'm gonna. What I'm gonna need to do is create you an account in my body so the I'll fill everything in and then they'll send you an invite link.
0:21:7.34 --> 0:21:7.234
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:21:10.354 --> 0:21:17.514
Kegan Wesley
And you should be set and then. I'll also forward you a an example of the new client information.
0:21:12.474 --> 0:21:12.914
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:21:17.514 --> 0:21:18.594
Kegan Wesley
What? What's your e-mail address?
0:21:18.664 --> 0:21:19.624
Kegan Wesley
That you prefer to use.
0:21:21.124 --> 0:21:23.444
Luis Escobar
Alescobar@enu.co.
0:21:27.714 --> 0:21:29.194
Kegan Wesley
I send it over after this call.
0:21:30.174 --> 0:21:31.14
Luis Escobar
Perfect. Thank you.
0:21:35.874 --> 0:21:40.154
Luis Escobar
But yeah, looking into this data I found some pretty like interesting things like.
0:21:42.434 --> 0:21:46.194
Luis Escobar
Regarding people's interest regarding people's like.
0:21:48.304 --> 0:21:50.104
Luis Escobar
You know what, what their goals were?
0:21:52.304 --> 0:21:53.664
Luis Escobar
That's that's awesome.
0:21:53.824 --> 0:21:57.624
Luis Escobar
I I know you guys mentioned you had that and now we we have a place to put it.
0:22:3.964 --> 0:22:17.124
Basement
What we what we really have been wanting to kind of add as a feature to our story is like we we ask them what their goals are at their most recent medical history update. But we don't ask them did you complete this goal?
0:22:4.644 --> 0:22:4.804
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
0:22:17.124 --> 0:22:22.884
Basement
We we might mark a symptom as completed or something like that. If we addressed it, but their goals.
0:22:24.754 --> 0:22:34.794
Basement
I think we just need like probably just a simple form that is able to look at those fields. Our limitation with the open dental.
0:22:34.864 --> 0:22:42.664
Basement
Dental before I think they just released a version where it actually allows you to pre fill forms from non database fields.
0:22:42.854 --> 0:22:46.814
Basement
But that was the problem before, so we couldn't send them a form saying, hey, have you?
0:22:48.344 --> 0:22:49.984
Basement
Fixed this or have you solved this goal yet?
0:22:49.984 --> 0:22:52.144
Basement
So that was something we were.
0:22:50.694 --> 0:22:51.414
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:22:52.504 --> 0:22:56.384
Basement
I think that's that's a big piece of what we're missing with how we present.
0:22:56.54 --> 0:23:14.54
Ted Ennenbach
Not that. Not only that, I mean, it wasn't really have you achieve your goal. It was actually where, where, where you could quantitatively say look to achieve the optimal buddy buddy mass index or weight, waistline you you know what what is that number?
0:23:14.54 --> 0:23:15.974
Ted Ennenbach
Is it you know for a girl?
0:23:16.14 --> 0:23:18.174
Ted Ennenbach
Is that 132 lbs.
0:23:18.214 --> 0:23:20.414
Ted Ennenbach
You know, is it a 26 inch waist?
0:23:21.114 --> 0:23:23.754
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, you know, like like like we so.
0:23:23.794 --> 0:23:25.754
Ted Ennenbach
So I think it would be great if.
0:23:26.574 --> 0:23:38.774
Ted Ennenbach
If we celebrated steps toward those actual quantitative goals, and so all the new forms that we make, I assume we're gonna make through HubSpot somehow.
0:23:39.94 --> 0:23:44.974
Ted Ennenbach
Because you know the the sheets using sheets and and open medical just sucks balls.
0:23:44.974 --> 0:23:51.174
Ted Ennenbach
So I mean we we need to as much as.
0:23:51.914 --> 0:23:56.634
Ted Ennenbach
Possible drill down on numeric goals.
0:23:57.464 --> 0:24:4.64
Ted Ennenbach
And instead of making them subjective, really you quantify those?
0:24:4.64 --> 0:24:8.104
Ted Ennenbach
So then we can, so so then we can post alerts, right?
0:24:8.104 --> 0:24:16.424
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, if somebody's wearing a watch that's synced to their apple scale, I mean, you know, we we we're daily weight and we can.
0:24:16.624 --> 0:24:20.344
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, I'm thinking you know ahead but but, but I mean.
0:24:21.834 --> 0:24:23.474
Ted Ennenbach
You know, how can we?
0:24:23.794 --> 0:24:26.874
Ted Ennenbach
How can we gamify this whole?
0:24:27.264 --> 0:24:31.424
Ted Ennenbach
Experience, you know, I mean, even aesthetics.
0:24:31.464 --> 0:24:36.304
Ted Ennenbach
I mean with aesthetics. AI selfies can now see Sun.
0:24:38.354 --> 0:24:44.954
Ted Ennenbach
Damage and and stuff like that. I see that someday being a cool feature.
0:24:46.104 --> 0:24:46.504
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:24:46.514 --> 0:24:48.74
Ted Ennenbach
And like an app you know.
0:24:49.444 --> 0:24:51.684
Luis Escobar
I can see that for sure for sure.
0:24:53.104 --> 0:24:57.824
Ted Ennenbach
So so really next steps is the data migration.
0:24:57.904 --> 0:24:59.744
Ted Ennenbach
Tell us who's gonna do it.
0:25:0.64 --> 0:25:19.274
Ted Ennenbach
I guess we we need to to look at all the fields in in mind body and and and put them in as close as we can to the associated fields that that are already created and if there aren't already create created fields we have to add new new.
0:25:19.274 --> 0:25:19.384
Ted Ennenbach
Ones.
0:25:20.114 --> 0:25:22.34
Ted Ennenbach
So if somebody just has to take take charge and say.
0:25:22.664 --> 0:25:25.504
Ted Ennenbach
Who's who's who's leading that?
0:25:27.34 --> 0:25:28.274
Ted Ennenbach
Stephen, are you going to lead?
0:25:28.274 --> 0:25:29.914
Ted Ennenbach
And delegate that or what?
0:25:30.394 --> 0:25:46.314
Basement
Yeah. I think based on what Louis has been able to do, I think if we, if I could provide him of the most recent like dump that we got from MINDBODY, we could probably just send that through the AI that will map most of the equivalent properties I.
0:25:46.304 --> 0:25:54.154
Basement
Guess to open medical and then hopefully can we can like manually assign other ones that it misses.
0:25:55.304 --> 0:25:59.984
Basement
But I think the the the more difficult part is just we got to create them all well.
0:25:55.664 --> 0:25:55.984
Luis Escobar
Correct.
0:26:0.374 --> 0:26:7.54
Basement
After we add the MINDBODY data, then I guess we'll have updated properties on every property we need to create.
0:26:7.854 --> 0:26:9.534
Basement
Then we just need to go create those.
0:26:10.304 --> 0:26:12.184
Luis Escobar
Correct. Yeah. I'm gonna run this whole.
0:26:10.944 --> 0:26:12.224
Basement
All the same name and same type.
0:26:13.504 --> 0:26:15.344
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'm gonna run this whole like, you know.
0:26:17.34 --> 0:26:18.634
Luis Escobar
AI on on all the fields.
0:26:18.634 --> 0:26:20.314
Luis Escobar
Again multiple times.
0:26:20.354 --> 0:26:28.74
Luis Escobar
And then eventually it's gonna, you know, condense it down to those, whatever. 202 fifty. I'm guessing it's gonna end up being.
0:26:28.394 --> 0:26:32.74
Luis Escobar
And then yeah, you're right.
0:26:32.314 --> 0:26:34.474
Luis Escobar
AI will do like 95% of it, right?
0:26:34.474 --> 0:26:38.434
Luis Escobar
But then that last 5%, we're gonna need someone to highball it.
0:26:38.434 --> 0:26:39.834
Luis Escobar
Who? Who actually?
0:26:40.144 --> 0:26:48.104
Luis Escobar
You know knows or is familiar with some of these fields or has seen them before that can, you know, do some QA and then make sure everything is kosher.
0:26:50.664 --> 0:26:53.944
Basement
I can probably leave that say.
0:26:55.984 --> 0:26:58.384
Basement
Mostly familiar with the database fields.
0:26:59.384 --> 0:26:59.584
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:27:0.664 --> 0:27:2.824
Basement
Mindbody. Not so much, but we'll figure that out.
0:27:0.664 --> 0:27:0.904
Kegan Wesley
In.
0:27:2.824 --> 0:27:4.744
Basement
I think a lot of it's pretty self-explanatory.
0:27:5.764 --> 0:27:6.164
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:27:5.794 --> 0:27:11.154
Kegan Wesley
Yeah, it's very user friendly. If I was able to to build it. It's very user friendly.
0:27:6.824 --> 0:27:6.984
Basement
It's.
0:27:11.354 --> 0:27:16.994
Kegan Wesley
I remember in the beginning when we were building it the way we wanted there were there were options.
0:27:18.474 --> 0:27:20.554
Kegan Wesley
To opt in and out of certain fields.
0:27:20.554 --> 0:27:26.74
Kegan Wesley
So I could maybe reach out to our Rep to see if they could be helpful. If we can't figure it out.
0:27:28.144 --> 0:27:28.464
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:27:28.504 --> 0:27:29.224
Luis Escobar
Yeah, good deal.
0:27:29.494 --> 0:27:30.814
Kegan Wesley
And then Luis, I need.
0:27:31.254 --> 0:27:34.334
Kegan Wesley
I need your phone number just to send you mind.
0:27:34.334 --> 0:27:37.254
Kegan Wesley
Body requires it for me to make you a staff member within my body.
0:27:37.654 --> 0:27:39.294
Luis Escobar
Yeah, 305.
0:27:40.54 --> 0:27:43.494
Luis Escobar
I know 19599.
0:27:44.754 --> 0:27:45.394
Kegan Wesley
Thank you.
0:27:53.284 --> 0:27:55.564
Luis Escobar
But yeah, you guys have a treasure trove of data.
0:27:55.564 --> 0:27:56.44
Luis Escobar
I'll just.
0:27:57.954 --> 0:28:1.474
Luis Escobar
Pass treatments and and their goals and that's that's awesome.
0:28:23.754 --> 0:28:24.194
Luis Escobar
So.
0:28:26.384 --> 0:28:31.64
Luis Escobar
How does the provider fields work exactly? Just?
0:28:32.634 --> 0:28:34.74
Luis Escobar
For for my understanding.
0:28:37.904 --> 0:28:40.664
Basement
The provider field OK.
0:28:40.664 --> 0:28:41.664
Basement
So there's two.
0:28:41.664 --> 0:28:43.184
Basement
I mean, there's two that we really use.
0:28:43.184 --> 0:28:49.184
Basement
There's the PROV NUM which would be the provider that did some procedure.
0:28:51.264 --> 0:28:53.744
Basement
Or is assigned to an operatory that's just like a.
0:28:55.734 --> 0:28:59.454
Basement
That is assigned to a person 1:00 to 1:00.
0:29:1.144 --> 0:29:3.864
Basement
They also have like a it's pride.
0:29:3.864 --> 0:29:10.824
Basement
Prav PRIPROB at prary provider. I guess it's also one to one to actual person, but it's like.
0:29:12.504 --> 0:29:18.504
Basement
Would be assault like each person could have one primary provider and you know multiple different.
0:29:20.764 --> 0:29:24.284
Basement
Prov. Service providers. I guess like so.
0:29:25.824 --> 0:29:26.664
Basement
How does it work?
0:29:25.844 --> 0:29:26.204
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:29:26.704 --> 0:29:32.264
Basement
There's some. There's like some automations. I think you have to change it.
0:29:33.24 --> 0:29:49.784
Basement
I think it's whoever you're whoever you're created is, say, is your pride your primary provider? Unless you change it manually and then it like default assigns your procedures and appointments to that provider unless it's created on another calendar or something.
0:29:41.734 --> 0:29:41.934
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:29:51.554 --> 0:29:52.114
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:29:52.914 --> 0:29:56.74
Luis Escobar
So yeah, I mean right here I have provider under score ID.
0:29:58.74 --> 0:29:59.74
Luis Escobar
Patients under score ID.
0:30:0.794 --> 0:30:0.994
Luis Escobar
Appointment.
0:30:2.634 --> 0:30:3.274
Luis Escobar
Clinic location.
0:30:4.994 --> 0:30:5.154
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:30:12.464 --> 0:30:24.624
Ted Ennenbach
In an effort for this experience to be a lead, do we have a column or do we identify the entire care team, meaning the provider, the medical?
0:30:26.914 --> 0:30:31.954
Ted Ennenbach
Assistant as well as the practice manager.
0:30:28.944 --> 0:30:29.424
Basement
Thank you.
0:30:33.674 --> 0:30:36.794
Ted Ennenbach
Is all that located in open dental too or no?
0:30:44.804 --> 0:30:46.204
Basement
No patient wouldn't be.
0:30:46.204 --> 0:30:46.684
Basement
I mean you.
0:30:46.684 --> 0:30:54.404
Basement
Would you would see their MA because they would. Well if you looked at the procedure log table you would see their MA because they would have had.
0:30:55.904 --> 0:30:59.24
Basement
Like a baseline or biomarker. Done.
0:30:59.424 --> 0:31:1.584
Basement
Procedure completed by that provider.
0:31:0.264 --> 0:31:0.464
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:31:3.624 --> 0:31:10.704
Basement
So you could see the patient number and relate that to the provider, but it's not directly saved in the patient table anywhere their MA or their MC.
0:31:10.704 --> 0:31:15.584
Basement
Actually, the MCA is for a little while I had a field.
0:31:15.934 --> 0:31:16.814
Basement
They were updating.
0:31:18.304 --> 0:31:25.584
Basement
Manually that I was trying to get automated but they kinda stopped using it. That was that was when Steve Flores was here.
0:31:23.464 --> 0:31:23.664
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:31:28.4 --> 0:31:33.764
Luis Escobar
So in in HubSpot, we're gonna technically, I guess create a a user.
0:31:35.234 --> 0:31:38.34
Luis Escobar
Or every provider, every staff member.
0:31:39.674 --> 0:31:41.834
Luis Escobar
They they would be on the free license, right?
0:31:41.834 --> 0:31:43.114
Luis Escobar
We wouldn't have to pay for that.
0:31:45.114 --> 0:31:49.874
Luis Escobar
But essentially it would be a user that's part of our organization and then we would put them under the provider.
0:31:50.24 --> 0:31:50.224
Luis Escobar
There.
0:31:53.434 --> 0:31:54.34
Luis Escobar
Tag.
0:31:57.604 --> 0:32:0.684
Luis Escobar
That way we can make associations between contacts and.
0:32:2.344 --> 0:32:3.824
Luis Escobar
And users that are providers.
0:32:3.824 --> 0:32:4.664
Luis Escobar
Users that are.
0:32:6.794 --> 0:32:9.954
Luis Escobar
Staff members or or account representatives.
0:32:14.584 --> 0:32:16.304
Basement
Practice managers as MC.
0:32:14.634 --> 0:32:24.394
Ted Ennenbach
I just envision a world I envision a world of telehealth where a provider can do so much more, can treat so many more.
0:32:14.644 --> 0:32:15.444
Luis Escobar
But yeah, we.
0:32:18.594 --> 0:32:18.634
Basement
A.
0:32:26.34 --> 0:32:47.474
Ted Ennenbach
Patients. So for now we have a provider that really gets maxed out at 400 because of the custom care that we provide and that provider has a full time MA and a full time practice manager as well. But I think with you know technology and the Const.
0:32:35.834 --> 0:32:36.34
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:32:47.474 --> 0:32:50.954
Ted Ennenbach
Drive toward efficiency. I see where you double that or triple that.
0:32:51.714 --> 0:32:55.794
Ted Ennenbach
But you know, AI is doing some work, but you would have.
0:32:56.484 --> 0:33:4.484
Ted Ennenbach
Maybe two Nas assigned to one provider so you know.
0:33:6.634 --> 0:33:25.114
Ted Ennenbach
I just I think it's gonna be really nice for a consumer to see their care team and and I think that would be the that would be the difference between us and anybody out there today is that they're assigned a unique care team, a member care associate, A.
0:33:14.104 --> 0:33:14.664
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:33:25.704 --> 0:33:42.184
Ted Ennenbach
Medical assistant, who probably has more touch to anybody and then the provider and then on the admin level, it would be the practice manager, which I guess on a telehealth basis probably didn't even exist really, but.
0:33:44.114 --> 0:33:55.754
Basement
I think it would be cool just to even to have like the option to have a care team like that would be the selected preference for like a lot of people. But then for the other people that just want to click in and get their medications as soon.
0:33:55.754 --> 0:33:56.154
Basement
As possible.
0:33:56.154 --> 0:33:58.394
Basement
Maybe they don't care who their doctor is.
0:33:58.514 --> 0:34:11.124
Basement
They just need somebody who can read their chart and prescribe them, deal with their next appointment like, you know, like having a kind of a rotating like maybe you see one provider this meeting and then a different provider this meeting that would be I think would be a.
0:34:11.114 --> 0:34:12.314
Basement
Cool feature to be able to.
0:34:12.354 --> 0:34:12.754
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:34:13.194 --> 0:34:15.434
Basement
Select whether you want to stay with the same provider or not.
0:34:15.544 --> 0:34:16.144
Basement
But.
0:34:19.664 --> 0:34:20.584
Luis Escobar
I do like that.
0:34:20.34 --> 0:34:21.474
Basement
That's obviously farther out in the future.
0:34:28.834 --> 0:34:40.314
Luis Escobar
So yeah, let's in regards to the data you know import I think we should just chip away at this and and you know I think if we.
0:34:41.794 --> 0:34:49.714
Luis Escobar
We get started now we, you know by end of next week or even sooner midweek we can have all the fields in HubSpot.
0:34:50.144 --> 0:34:50.304
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:34:55.644 --> 0:34:56.804
Basement
Tell us what to do, boss.
0:34:58.314 --> 0:35:0.154
Basement
You just got a map all the fields.
0:35:0.154 --> 0:35:0.514
Basement
You know what's sweet?
0:35:0.794 --> 0:35:3.274
Basement
Yeah. You, me, you and I can help, but.
0:35:1.944 --> 0:35:11.864
Luis Escobar
Yeah, as soon as I get my hands on those, those other CSB exports, I'll do a final, you know, AI run, and then we can.
0:35:11.944 --> 0:35:16.64
Luis Escobar
I'll share with you guys the exact objects, the exact names.
0:35:17.554 --> 0:35:21.74
Luis Escobar
To just copy and paste and and start helping me create all these fields.
0:35:27.384 --> 0:35:28.64
Basement
Sounds good.
0:35:28.64 --> 0:35:29.184
Basement
I will share that.
0:35:29.184 --> 0:35:38.264
Basement
I'm gonna share the most recent mind body dump that we did so you can get all the fields in that database folder that I created for us.
0:35:38.664 --> 0:35:39.24
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:35:39.644 --> 0:35:48.724
Kegan Wesley
Steven, do you think that we could potentially go back to that day and then ask for a new dump and it would be a less expensive cost or is it $500 each time?
0:35:40.514 --> 0:35:40.674
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:35:49.324 --> 0:35:49.884
Basement
I don't think.
0:35:49.884 --> 0:35:52.604
Basement
I don't think it'd be less expensive.
0:35:53.954 --> 0:35:54.434
Basement
They're pretty.
0:35:54.754 --> 0:35:57.754
Basement
They they were pretty stout on $500 every time just to do it.
0:35:58.904 --> 0:36:3.584
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that's interesting that, that they even offer that they they must get a lot of requests for that.
0:35:59.594 --> 0:36:0.234
Basement
Remember, yeah.
0:36:4.234 --> 0:36:15.794
Basement
Well, it's. I remember now why it took a couple days longer is because they normally give it to you upon canceling your subscription with them. And it was different for us because we were not canceling our account, so.
0:36:12.834 --> 0:36:13.234
Kegan Wesley
Yeah.
0:36:17.314 --> 0:36:18.354
Basement
They provided to us still.
0:36:19.394 --> 0:36:19.514
Luis Escobar
Hmm.
0:36:21.704 --> 0:36:22.104
Luis Escobar
Got it.
0:36:24.184 --> 0:36:27.24
Kegan Wesley
I'm new to the conversation, but have we talked anything about?
0:36:28.474 --> 0:36:37.354
Kegan Wesley
The like outreach data that we hope to capture with give that we have captured with giveaways, but that we can we hope to continue to do so.
0:36:37.354 --> 0:36:38.634
Kegan Wesley
Have we talked about that at all?
0:36:42.664 --> 0:36:47.184
Luis Escobar
I can say too much. I I think there was a mention of of the giveaway program.
0:36:48.594 --> 0:36:55.234
Luis Escobar
But definitely that's I see that as just like a a component of our affiliate. You know program overall, right.
0:36:48.704 --> 0:36:49.144
Kegan Wesley
Thank you.
0:36:55.634 --> 0:36:55.794
Kegan Wesley
Yeah.
0:36:57.314 --> 0:36:59.154
Luis Escobar
We we wanna have a really strong.
0:37:1.234 --> 0:37:1.834
Luis Escobar
Just a.
0:37:1.834 --> 0:37:5.394
Luis Escobar
A Philly partnership program. We'll have different levels of Affiliates too.
0:37:5.394 --> 0:37:10.594
Luis Escobar
We'll have, you know, clients, customers who are always instant affiliates.
0:37:10.594 --> 0:37:13.554
Luis Escobar
You know, we'll, we'll have actually like dedicated.
0:37:13.824 --> 0:37:16.624
Luis Escobar
Affiliates and then JB partners.
0:37:18.394 --> 0:37:26.34
Luis Escobar
You know, I think there's room to work with some of these influencers and UGC content creators, right?
0:37:27.714 --> 0:37:31.474
Luis Escobar
But yeah, definitely the the giveaway component, it will be part of it.
0:37:32.784 --> 0:37:33.184
Kegan Wesley
OK.
0:37:33.544 --> 0:37:52.154
Kegan Wesley
I mainly ask that question is in case we need to be thinking what fields that we need to maybe add to the web forms that people enter to win. If there's some important other than the basic of what name, e-mail and phone number. If there are certain things.
0:37:52.154 --> 0:37:56.504
Kegan Wesley
That we would like to like a skin quiz or a, you know, optimal quiz, whatever.
0:37:57.754 --> 0:38:3.914
Kegan Wesley
Let us know because I mean, that's something that we're we continually do on the aesthetic side is giveaways, affiliates, UCG type.
0:38:4.304 --> 0:38:4.984
Kegan Wesley
That type thing.
0:38:4.984 --> 0:38:12.864
Kegan Wesley
So we need, I think we're launching 1 next week potentially. So if we need to edit that to fit in this, please let please let.
0:38:10.384 --> 0:38:10.784
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
0:38:14.394 --> 0:38:14.674
Kegan Wesley
Me know.
0:38:14.674 --> 0:38:16.154
Kegan Wesley
Marissa know more importantly, Marissa.
0:38:18.104 --> 0:38:19.24
Luis Escobar
Purdue, Purdue.
0:38:22.114 --> 0:38:24.794
Luis Escobar
Are do you guys ask if people are married?
0:38:26.524 --> 0:38:27.284
Basement
Yes.
0:38:28.254 --> 0:38:30.734
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we got last.
0:38:29.674 --> 0:38:32.274
Basement
Yeah. On the registration form.
0:38:33.414 --> 0:38:37.54
Luis Escobar
OK. 'cause. Yeah. The last meeting or previous one, we had a good idea about.
0:38:37.54 --> 0:38:42.94
Luis Escobar
Just like, for example, couples competing against each other to see who like gets healthier, right?
0:38:43.954 --> 0:38:49.274
Luis Escobar
Kind of like I think something like that creative idea like that could be an interesting campaign.
0:38:50.434 --> 0:38:54.234
Kegan Wesley
Or single girls competing against single girls to see who gets married first.
0:38:50.954 --> 0:38:51.314
Luis Escobar
But then we.
0:38:54.514 --> 0:38:55.274
Kegan Wesley
I'm just kidding.
0:38:54.764 --> 0:38:54.844
Luis Escobar
No.
0:38:57.64 --> 0:38:57.904
Luis Escobar
That's hilarious.
0:38:58.764 --> 0:39:8.844
Ted Ennenbach
Well, Lewis had a cool idea. I mean, you, you you keep all of this in your own new life eco system.
0:39:9.84 --> 0:39:15.764
Ted Ennenbach
It could potentially become a social thing too. I mean, so, so your, your your idea?
0:39:17.234 --> 0:39:18.754
Ted Ennenbach
Kagan isn't wrong.
0:39:18.834 --> 0:39:28.594
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, you know where where they can say, hey, how do I rank? You know, with civil, you know, 2530 year old girls.
0:39:29.184 --> 0:39:30.824
Ted Ennenbach
My my age.
0:39:30.824 --> 0:39:32.504
Ted Ennenbach
How does my health score?
0:39:32.504 --> 0:39:34.184
Ted Ennenbach
How does my aesthetic score?
0:39:34.704 --> 0:39:35.344
Ted Ennenbach
You know that.
0:39:35.344 --> 0:39:36.264
Ted Ennenbach
That kind of thing.
0:39:36.304 --> 0:39:38.224
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, it's not a bad idea.
0:39:38.684 --> 0:39:39.884
Luis Escobar
No, no, not at all.
0:39:45.454 --> 0:39:48.14
Kegan Wesley
Yeah, there's this new obsession with biohacking.
0:39:48.14 --> 0:39:55.734
Kegan Wesley
So I think that, you know, the Kardashians just went to what's his name, Brian, that has like, a whole biohacking studio within his home.
0:39:56.664 --> 0:39:57.624
Basement
Ryan Johnson.
0:39:57.354 --> 0:39:57.434
Kegan Wesley
So.
0:39:58.914 --> 0:39:59.554
Kegan Wesley
His dad's name.
0:39:59.254 --> 0:39:59.614
Luis Escobar
Oh yeah.
0:39:59.874 --> 0:40:0.474
Basement
Yeah.
0:40:1.74 --> 0:40:2.234
Kegan Wesley
Yeah. Insane.
0:40:2.234 --> 0:40:15.714
Kegan Wesley
But you know, Ted did have, you know, a good idea the other day of keeping, like, a bio hack score of, you know, you're 50 years old. But by doing this, that can this can bring you down to 40 and doing that.
0:40:15.984 --> 0:40:18.584
Kegan Wesley
I can bring it to 38 and so on and so forth.
0:40:18.624 --> 0:40:21.184
Kegan Wesley
Something fun on the app that would.
0:40:22.464 --> 0:40:23.664
Kegan Wesley
Challenge people to.
0:40:25.154 --> 0:40:25.714
Kegan Wesley
Be younger.
0:40:26.374 --> 0:40:30.774
Basement
There's actually there's like anti aging competitions that they have now.
0:40:30.774 --> 0:40:43.734
Basement
It's like becoming a like a sport where people like have the highest anti aging score that it's I guess I don't know what it's built off of but like I guess a bunch of different lab test levels but you you could look up like who?
0:40:43.734 --> 0:40:45.614
Basement
Who's like the top people on that?
0:40:47.674 --> 0:40:48.314
Luis Escobar
That is funny.
0:40:52.714 --> 0:40:55.74
Luis Escobar
All right, so I'm sharing here my screen.
0:40:55.514 --> 0:40:56.834
Luis Escobar
I shared this link earlier.
0:40:56.834 --> 0:40:59.954
Luis Escobar
I'm not have have any of you had a chance to review it?
0:41:1.354 --> 0:41:2.634
Basement
Yeah, I'll look at it.
0:41:3.484 --> 0:41:4.524
Brian Hyatt
I have, yes.
0:41:6.124 --> 0:41:12.884
Luis Escobar
So yeah, what I I really wanted to like focus on these lead magnets, right.
0:41:14.354 --> 0:41:17.794
Luis Escobar
The whole of the website is, you know, all those inner pages, all all those.
0:41:19.434 --> 0:41:20.994
Luis Escobar
Other miscellaneous pages.
0:41:21.114 --> 0:41:22.914
Luis Escobar
That stuff really doesn't move the needle.
0:41:22.914 --> 0:41:26.714
Luis Escobar
It's it's really these lead magnets that that are gonna help us pivot.
0:41:28.434 --> 0:41:28.914
Luis Escobar
So I know.
0:41:28.914 --> 0:41:31.114
Luis Escobar
I know you guys already had a few and I try to build upon that.
0:41:31.474 --> 0:41:35.434
Luis Escobar
So what you're seeing here is a few different assets that we're gonna use.
0:41:36.194 --> 0:41:40.634
Luis Escobar
In different parts of the website. Starting here with the complete weight loss assessment.
0:41:52.584 --> 0:41:52.664
Luis Escobar
No.
0:41:58.254 --> 0:41:59.854
Luis Escobar
Probably ask if they're married here.
0:42:7.774 --> 0:42:11.574
Basement
It just looks so, so much more sleep than any any forms we have.
0:42:19.984 --> 0:42:25.744
Luis Escobar
So I'll need your team to like, you know, go through this with a find calm and make sure the language makes sense.
0:42:25.744 --> 0:42:27.624
Luis Escobar
Or maybe we should add or remove questions.
0:42:31.924 --> 0:42:32.844
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yeah, the date.
0:42:34.304 --> 0:42:40.304
Renzo Mogrovejo
On the birthday we can we can change it and put first a month and after that the date.
0:42:35.834 --> 0:42:36.34
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:42:57.414 --> 0:42:58.734
Luis Escobar
This is a simple result.
0:43:0.224 --> 0:43:0.744
Luis Escobar
This can evolve.
0:43:0.864 --> 0:43:11.304
Luis Escobar
We can have cool graphics and charts here, but right now what is telling us is just, you know, this is your personalized result, BMI, some recommendations.
0:43:12.944 --> 0:43:16.144
Luis Escobar
Next steps I can either take the assessment again or schedule a call.
0:43:16.144 --> 0:43:24.384
Luis Escobar
Schedule a consultation and so we can. You know, that'll be one lead magnet, 1 landing page or multiple landing pages can use the same lead magnet, right?
0:43:26.634 --> 0:43:27.914
Luis Escobar
Personalized health survey.
0:43:43.374 --> 0:43:44.894
Luis Escobar
Looks great on mobile.
0:43:47.394 --> 0:43:49.634
Luis Escobar
70% of our traffic will be mobile.
0:44:17.64 --> 0:44:18.144
Luis Escobar
Get my assessment?
0:44:20.54 --> 0:44:21.574
Luis Escobar
Same deal, right? So.
0:44:23.364 --> 0:44:25.964
Luis Escobar
Recommendations area of focus apparently.
0:44:25.964 --> 0:44:29.724
Luis Escobar
I click that and then recommended next steps.
0:44:32.864 --> 0:44:36.784
Luis Escobar
Personalized recommendations to comprehensive hormone optimization program.
0:44:36.784 --> 0:44:38.264
Luis Escobar
Apparently that's a good idea for me.
0:44:40.4 --> 0:44:52.524
Luis Escobar
Right. So now we will take this data right and then we'll, we'll create an automated e-mail campaign and automated SMS campaign that that flows and really resonates with with what they you know chose.
0:44:56.114 --> 0:44:57.154
Luis Escobar
Let's go back.
0:44:58.784 --> 0:45:2.704
Luis Escobar
That's the second lead magnet. Now we got the third one.
0:45:2.704 --> 0:45:4.744
Luis Escobar
This was a good idea from our last meeting.
0:45:5.304 --> 0:45:7.504
Luis Escobar
This is the membership value calculator.
0:45:11.344 --> 0:45:11.984
Luis Escobar
So here I want.
0:45:11.984 --> 0:45:12.944
Luis Escobar
This one I want.
0:45:12.944 --> 0:45:20.664
Luis Escobar
This one want this one. I want this one, this one, this one, this one and this one.
0:45:22.774 --> 0:45:26.54
Luis Escobar
So I'm gonna have to pay 2380.
0:45:27.374 --> 0:45:31.894
Luis Escobar
Or I can sign up for this membership, save myself 357 bucks.
0:45:34.14 --> 0:45:43.534
Kegan Wesley
Is this something that the like aesthetic providers or even optimal health providers can utilize in the room like with?
0:45:37.784 --> 0:45:37.824
Luis Escobar
G.
0:45:44.984 --> 0:45:47.664
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we can definitely make a version of that for that purpose there.
0:45:47.824 --> 0:45:48.304
Kegan Wesley
Bye.
0:45:48.664 --> 0:45:52.704
Luis Escobar
There could be one that's for, you know, a landing page for ads.
0:45:54.344 --> 0:45:54.504
Luis Escobar
Copy.
0:45:57.494 --> 0:45:58.254
Luis Escobar
Oh yeah.
0:46:4.834 --> 0:46:6.114
Luis Escobar
Scott Scott home.
0:46:8.624 --> 0:46:11.464
Luis Escobar
But yeah, what are your thoughts on this right here?
0:46:15.314 --> 0:46:16.994
Luis Escobar
This whole membership calculator.
0:46:19.24 --> 0:46:19.864
Kegan Wesley
I think it's really cool.
0:46:20.654 --> 0:46:21.734
Basement
That looks great. I love it.
0:46:21.734 --> 0:46:26.334
Basement
Yeah, need to do a little cleaning up like prices in some of the products, but yeah, it looks looks good.
0:46:28.614 --> 0:46:32.134
Luis Escobar
And I think it it does it make a big impact, right?
0:46:32.134 --> 0:46:35.134
Luis Escobar
If you can show them the savings right.
0:46:41.624 --> 0:46:46.264
Luis Escobar
These two memberships I know this is what you guys have in person membership and telehealth membership.
0:46:49.934 --> 0:46:51.14
Luis Escobar
We'll we'll cover that now.
0:46:52.674 --> 0:46:56.154
Kegan Wesley
And then I don't know if we want to include, but we also have an aesthetic membership as well.
0:46:57.664 --> 0:46:59.744
Kegan Wesley
So we could include that in there as well.
0:47:0.584 --> 0:47:1.104
Luis Escobar
All right.
0:47:3.334 --> 0:47:5.494
Basement
Membership and a senior membership also.
0:47:7.614 --> 0:47:8.54
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:47:8.134 --> 0:47:9.534
Luis Escobar
Definitely, yeah, we'll get those.
0:47:8.434 --> 0:47:12.314
Basement
Those kind of full, those kind of fall under the in person membership though?
0:47:13.14 --> 0:47:13.494
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:47:14.894 --> 0:47:16.454
Luis Escobar
I'm gonna skip those smart booking.
0:47:16.454 --> 0:47:17.174
Luis Escobar
We'll come back to that.
0:47:17.174 --> 0:47:18.694
Luis Escobar
Let's talk about the membership.
0:47:20.944 --> 0:47:28.264
Luis Escobar
My thought was on this in person membership and telehealth membership and the pricing and the value.
0:47:34.764 --> 0:47:36.924
Luis Escobar
Is there another way to like present this?
0:47:36.924 --> 0:47:40.204
Luis Escobar
A different wording, like silver membership, gold membership.
0:47:42.234 --> 0:47:42.794
Luis Escobar
Or.
0:47:44.874 --> 0:47:47.754
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, there's there's really no ****.
0:47:45.204 --> 0:47:45.684
Luis Escobar
Like.
0:47:47.954 --> 0:47:48.434
Luis Escobar
Is it?
0:47:49.144 --> 0:47:51.824
Ted Ennenbach
There's really no reason why.
0:47:53.704 --> 0:48:5.384
Ted Ennenbach
I because I don't know why you would be serving a telehealth option to anybody within a 20 mile radius or 10 mile radius of of a brick and mortar office.
0:48:7.144 --> 0:48:9.144
Ted Ennenbach
I figure that option would exist though.
0:48:9.144 --> 0:48:13.904
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, if that's the form of care that they want, then we have to go to get to EM.
0:48:15.884 --> 0:48:19.484
Ted Ennenbach
It's just there's such a big difference in price.
0:48:22.264 --> 0:48:22.984
Luis Escobar
I don't know.
0:48:23.24 --> 0:48:25.744
Luis Escobar
Also, like when you call it telehealth, it sounds super boring.
0:48:25.744 --> 0:48:26.504
Luis Escobar
I don't want to pay for that.
0:48:29.694 --> 0:48:34.94
Basement
Virtual membership. Now you need something like a custom like.
0:48:31.644 --> 0:48:35.964
Luis Escobar
Of yeah, health optimization program.
0:48:37.54 --> 0:48:37.534
Luis Escobar
And then.
0:48:38.354 --> 0:48:39.794
Basement
Yeah, we we have been.
0:48:39.304 --> 0:48:39.344
Luis Escobar
D.
0:48:39.794 --> 0:48:47.994
Basement
We have been calling like the new optimal health. What is that like? That'd be the in person, new optimal health membership.
0:48:48.34 --> 0:48:50.554
Basement
That was kind of our tagline.
0:48:51.224 --> 0:48:52.904
Luis Escobar
New optimal health membership.
0:48:52.104 --> 0:48:52.224
Basement
And.
0:48:52.904 --> 0:48:54.24
Luis Escobar
So that's that's your.
0:48:54.24 --> 0:48:55.64
Luis Escobar
That's your entry.
0:48:54.104 --> 0:48:54.264
Basement
Then.
0:48:55.184 --> 0:48:58.864
Luis Escobar
You pay 150, you get that, and if you want the premium experience.
0:48:59.634 --> 0:49:3.834
Basement
Or that that was what we called the yeah, the in person, but regardless.
0:49:3.44 --> 0:49:10.124
Luis Escobar
The in person because yeah, right now it feels like you're you're making a big deal about it being in person and it is a big deal.
0:49:11.784 --> 0:49:19.544
Luis Escobar
Right. But I don't want just because they're not in person. I don't want them to not pay or or sign up for the premium service.
0:49:21.264 --> 0:49:23.224
Luis Escobar
And I mean, what's the big differentiator here?
0:49:23.224 --> 0:49:26.464
Luis Escobar
Is it the five, the 15% versus the 5%?
0:49:28.474 --> 0:49:34.754
Basement
The telehealth isn't supposed to have. I think there's no discount associated with telehealth membership for aesthetic treatments.
0:49:36.154 --> 0:49:36.554
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:49:36.354 --> 0:49:43.394
Basement
Correct. Because they're they're not close to a clinic or. Yeah, that's the whole thing is they're not coming into the clinic.
0:49:43.634 --> 0:49:44.874
Basement
So they can't get aesthetic.
0:49:48.4 --> 0:49:48.924
Luis Escobar
I get it, I get it.
0:49:50.104 --> 0:49:52.624
Basement
I will say you add it anyways.
0:49:52.664 --> 0:50:2.984
Basement
Yeah, I mean you I think we could add like a percentage off of like the products like skin care products, just another benefit in the likelihood. I mean if they come in and get it great.
0:50:2.984 --> 0:50:4.624
Basement
If not, yeah.
0:50:4.624 --> 0:50:15.24
Basement
Or we just ship it to them, like if they if they need neocutis or ZO and they wanna order through our app, they can get a 5% discount if they buy a membership and then they ship it to them, you know that would be.
0:50:16.344 --> 0:50:17.664
Kegan Wesley
The only thing is.
0:50:16.694 --> 0:50:23.934
Ted Ennenbach
There almost needs to be a there almost needs to be a way in which they fill out something, and we recommend.
0:50:17.254 --> 0:50:17.374
Luis Escobar
And.
0:50:25.384 --> 0:50:28.184
Ted Ennenbach
What? What membership is best for them?
0:50:28.184 --> 0:50:30.64
Ted Ennenbach
I mean what?
0:50:29.424 --> 0:50:29.624
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:50:30.64 --> 0:50:30.744
Ted Ennenbach
What are?
0:50:30.744 --> 0:50:31.104
Ted Ennenbach
What are their goals?
0:50:31.104 --> 0:50:31.544
Ted Ennenbach
What are they?
0:50:31.544 --> 0:50:33.24
Ted Ennenbach
What are they trying to achieve?
0:50:34.164 --> 0:50:34.364
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:50:35.264 --> 0:50:36.824
Ted Ennenbach
And and then the associated.
0:50:38.504 --> 0:50:43.544
Ted Ennenbach
Membership would would you know, good, you know. Good, good, good, better, best kind of thing.
0:50:45.204 --> 0:50:45.324
Ted Ennenbach
Umm.
0:50:48.974 --> 0:50:51.734
Ted Ennenbach
They they get fewer. I'm sorry.
0:50:49.244 --> 0:50:50.44
Luis Escobar
I mean, yeah, it's.
0:50:51.734 --> 0:50:52.54
Ted Ennenbach
Go ahead.
0:50:52.654 --> 0:50:53.614
Luis Escobar
No, go ahead. Go ahead.
0:50:56.934 --> 0:50:59.854
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, the the the difference was with the telehealth.
0:50:59.854 --> 0:51:0.414
Ted Ennenbach
Is that there?
0:51:0.414 --> 0:51:5.494
Ted Ennenbach
There's either fewer meetings or they were they were not as long.
0:51:5.774 --> 0:51:13.934
Ted Ennenbach
So so it was taking. So in theory a provider could do twice as many.
0:51:6.404 --> 0:51:6.524
Luis Escobar
Mm H.
0:51:15.384 --> 0:51:19.104
Ted Ennenbach
In the same period as they could with an in person, so.
0:51:21.944 --> 0:51:22.464
Luis Escobar
I got it.
0:51:22.834 --> 0:51:30.714
Basement
You also don't get the like IV shots that are included with the program. Vitamin shots, not IV.
0:51:30.834 --> 0:51:33.794
Basement
Yeah. Vitamin and I think you have.
0:51:33.794 --> 0:51:42.114
Basement
You also have to like pay extra for like coming into the office like if you had to see somebody for like there's a consultation fee for an in person visit, yeah.
0:51:43.544 --> 0:51:44.824
Basement
Believe it's $120.00.
0:51:48.64 --> 0:51:48.344
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:51:49.134 --> 0:51:50.894
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I mean, I can't.
0:51:51.94 --> 0:51:56.94
Ted Ennenbach
What does map? This is silly cuz I think we need to map out all.
0:51:56.644 --> 0:52:10.164
Ted Ennenbach
The memberships that we have because I don't think that I don't think that you took into consideration you know the the junior, the senior and the aesthetics.
0:52:0.864 --> 0:52:1.464
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:52:2.684 --> 0:52:2.804
Basement
Yes.
0:52:10.774 --> 0:52:10.974
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:52:11.814 --> 0:52:25.974
Ted Ennenbach
And then I I still really like the the old survey that we had that really asks you a budget question about how you feel anybody over 35 or 40?
0:52:26.364 --> 0:52:29.164
Ted Ennenbach
And it would tell you whether you were likely.
0:52:30.894 --> 0:52:47.54
Ted Ennenbach
Low, definitely low, or you're good on which hormone it told us a lot more about how to market to to them down the road. You know? So, so, so that I don't want to abandon that one.
0:52:40.214 --> 0:52:40.814
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:52:47.824 --> 0:52:49.184
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Where can I see that one?
0:52:50.724 --> 0:52:51.964
Brian Hyatt
Just dropped it in the chat.
0:52:50.864 --> 0:52:56.344
Ted Ennenbach
It's on the 25 five again site.
0:52:54.404 --> 0:52:55.404
Luis Escobar
25 again.
0:52:56.344 --> 0:52:56.824
Ted Ennenbach
I sent you a link.
0:52:57.264 --> 0:52:58.904
Basement
Brian just dropped it in the chat.
0:52:57.424 --> 0:52:59.584
Brian Hyatt
I just dropped it in the chat. Yeah.
0:52:57.564 --> 0:52:58.364
Luis Escobar
This one.
0:52:58.654 --> 0:52:58.694
Ted Ennenbach
I.
0:53:0.104 --> 0:53:1.744
Luis Escobar
The personalized health survey.
0:53:0.374 --> 0:53:0.934
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:53:2.204 --> 0:53:2.524
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
0:53:3.254 --> 0:53:7.334
Luis Escobar
So that is supposed to be this one right here. The personalized health survey.
0:53:9.774 --> 0:53:13.454
Luis Escobar
It it may not be matching 1 to one on the results.
0:53:13.574 --> 0:53:14.134
Luis Escobar
I think so.
0:53:14.134 --> 0:53:20.134
Luis Escobar
We're. I'm gonna have to fine tune that, but yeah, that that was the goal with this right here.
0:53:18.744 --> 0:53:19.544
Ted Ennenbach
OK, OK.
0:53:19.544 --> 0:53:20.984
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, that that's fine.
0:53:20.984 --> 0:53:25.664
Ted Ennenbach
I haven't been been through them all, so if that's yeah.
0:53:21.774 --> 0:53:21.854
Luis Escobar
To.
0:53:26.824 --> 0:53:26.984
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:53:28.944 --> 0:53:43.64
Kegan Wesley
And then I know there was talks on the current and new website that there was going to be like a skin quiz or an aesthetic skin anesthetic quiz that would talk through something similar to the allergen console form.
0:53:44.494 --> 0:53:48.174
Kegan Wesley
I'll send you a link of of me skin quiz.
0:53:48.174 --> 0:53:52.734
Kegan Wesley
It's pretty good and I think that could be beneficial to.
0:53:50.904 --> 0:53:51.224
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:53:55.54 --> 0:53:57.574
Kegan Wesley
Drop some info from a potential new client.
0:53:58.824 --> 0:53:59.304
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:54:0.184 --> 0:54:0.944
Luis Escobar
So yeah, that's great.
0:54:0.944 --> 0:54:1.944
Luis Escobar
I mean, that's another quiz.
0:54:1.944 --> 0:54:9.744
Luis Escobar
So like right here, we have the weight loss assessment we have the personalized health survey and then you're gonna send another one of the skin quiz, right?
0:54:9.744 --> 0:54:12.624
Luis Escobar
So these are all gonna be different lead magnets, right?
0:54:12.624 --> 0:54:16.464
Luis Escobar
That will allocate a certain amount of the ad budget too.
0:54:18.414 --> 0:54:33.134
Luis Escobar
Just to wrap up on the my thoughts on the membership, I I definitely wanna, you know, evaluate the entire scope of all the membership packages you guys have. And I I can put my finger on it right now, but I I know there's a better way to get.
0:54:33.134 --> 0:54:38.974
Luis Escobar
A little bit more creative on the just the the value placement and the pricing placement.
0:54:39.864 --> 0:54:40.584
Luis Escobar
Right.
0:54:41.934 --> 0:54:42.814
Luis Escobar
The branding right?
0:54:44.574 --> 0:54:44.854
Luis Escobar
You know.
0:54:48.14 --> 0:55:2.454
Basement
I kind of this might be time for, I don't know, a different time to bring this up, but I was kind of talking with Trent about especially for the telehealth membership. We're asking them to make, you know, especially for the annual plan pay upfront 1300.
0:55:2.454 --> 0:55:11.654
Basement
$41.00 commitment based off of just seeing a website. Basically what are thoughts on like moving payment of that back until after you see.
0:55:12.774 --> 0:55:15.894
Basement
A provider for the first time, like we do for our in person membership.
0:55:16.244 --> 0:55:20.684
Basement
'Cause, right now we're kind of making our MC as who don't really know.
0:55:22.934 --> 0:55:30.214
Basement
What all the program can offer as well as the providers making them sell the program instead of the providers, which kind of where we had success, I feel like in the past.
0:55:31.694 --> 0:55:32.654
Basement
With our baseline percentages.
0:55:34.254 --> 0:55:34.374
Basement
And.
0:55:35.604 --> 0:55:36.204
Basement
But.
0:55:36.604 --> 0:55:38.204
Luis Escobar
The point I think it's something to test.
0:55:42.274 --> 0:55:49.954
Luis Escobar
If it if it results in like higher convergence and just more retention doing it basically vice versa.
0:55:54.424 --> 0:55:55.64
Basement
It's just.
0:55:54.674 --> 0:56:2.754
Luis Escobar
I was also thinking something like if you have two membership packages or three membership packages and then there's also an add on feature.
0:56:3.884 --> 0:56:12.764
Luis Escobar
If you wanna be, you know, eligible for the in person benefits, click here and add this add on to your membership for an additional 100 bucks.
0:56:14.74 --> 0:56:14.754
Kegan Wesley
That's cool.
0:56:18.234 --> 0:56:19.154
Luis Escobar
Something like that.
0:56:19.764 --> 0:56:34.724
Ted Ennenbach
You you wouldn't need to display all of this if you knew if you knew more about what they're if you knew more about what their goals were and and what their age was, then you wouldn't need to display everything.
0:56:22.324 --> 0:56:23.324
Basement
Hard to like.
0:56:23.804 --> 0:56:25.204
Basement
Think of what that would apply to.
0:56:26.734 --> 0:56:26.814
Basement
So.
0:56:34.724 --> 0:56:36.4
Ted Ennenbach
It would already.
0:56:37.454 --> 0:56:44.734
Ted Ennenbach
Suggest for you a price point or a membership that is most accurate so.
0:56:44.934 --> 0:56:49.454
Luis Escobar
Yeah, you're absolutely right, 'cause that you don't wanna give him information overload, right?
0:56:49.734 --> 0:56:50.974
Ted Ennenbach
Right, right.
0:56:49.854 --> 0:56:52.974
Luis Escobar
And so information paralysis.
0:56:51.214 --> 0:57:0.614
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, I mean you don't send a 68 year old guy who's on a fixed income, you know, a three $3000.
0:56:58.364 --> 0:56:58.564
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:57:2.334 --> 0:57:7.654
Ted Ennenbach
Two $299 a month and and you know, not not including meds.
0:57:7.734 --> 0:57:20.814
Ted Ennenbach
You know this guy's wanting to live his best life, but he's also looking at hey, I've got so much money a month, you know, and I'm so, so, so. So we we want to be able to capture.
0:57:21.44 --> 0:57:23.964
Ted Ennenbach
Say same is true for a 24 year old, right?
0:57:24.124 --> 0:57:33.244
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, you know, we some of this medical heavy medical stuff, if they see 200, it might just turn them off.
0:57:33.564 --> 0:57:38.484
Ted Ennenbach
So you know where, you know, they don't need to see that stuff, so.
0:57:36.124 --> 0:57:36.604
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:57:38.874 --> 0:57:39.874
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I agree with that.
0:57:39.874 --> 0:57:50.154
Luis Escobar
If anything, two options like they they go through this survey process and then in the end it decipheres that you know this person is best fit for the.
0:57:51.574 --> 0:58:2.374
Luis Escobar
Aesthetic membership. And then there's either, you know, the the monthly payments or the six month, you know, payment option and you save 15% if you pay six months in advance.
0:58:4.294 --> 0:58:4.974
Luis Escobar
But no more.
0:58:4.974 --> 0:58:7.254
Luis Escobar
No more option or decision making beyond that.
0:58:10.534 --> 0:58:15.694
Ted Ennenbach
You know what? One thing that that they do now is the aesthetic books online.
0:58:16.594 --> 0:58:16.794
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:58:17.14 --> 0:58:31.14
Ted Ennenbach
And and and when they book book online, they're required to pay a $25 just kind of note note we we can make that whatever we we want. But one thing you could do at that very point.
0:58:32.534 --> 0:58:38.774
Ted Ennenbach
Say hey, you just booked a $220 hydra facial.
0:58:38.934 --> 0:58:40.54
Ted Ennenbach
Would you like to join?
0:58:40.724 --> 0:58:51.324
Ted Ennenbach
Now like like like save whatever you this this can be marked down. Now if you agree to join and become a recurring monthly member.
0:58:49.774 --> 0:58:49.894
Basement
2.
0:58:51.324 --> 0:59:0.724
Ted Ennenbach
Now you know you'll you'll save right now on this very first schedule thing to where we're not trying to sell it in office.
0:59:0.764 --> 0:59:2.124
Ted Ennenbach
It sells itself.
0:59:4.674 --> 0:59:5.154
Luis Escobar
I like that.
0:59:7.244 --> 0:59:17.764
Kegan Wesley
What we could do is like a first time offer cause we collecting $99.00 from them, then by them being a aesthetic member, they get $35 off that hydrofacial.
0:59:17.764 --> 0:59:31.284
Kegan Wesley
So we could potentially market it in the cart there where that 99 is put towards a HYDRA facial plus a $35 discount that they could get, you know, a hydrofacial for whatever that math is, but that insane discount.
0:59:31.284 --> 0:59:33.84
Kegan Wesley
So they're paying like 80 bucks for.
0:59:33.854 --> 0:59:35.934
Kegan Wesley
You know, hydrofacial cool.
0:59:35.664 --> 0:59:36.64
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:59:36.564 --> 0:59:37.924
Kegan Wesley
It could be like so.
0:59:39.534 --> 0:59:42.214
Kegan Wesley
It's too good to be true for them to say no, you know.
0:59:44.64 --> 0:59:47.984
Luis Escobar
That's how you want to make them feel like it's a it's a no brainer deal. It's it's.
0:59:48.564 --> 0:59:50.4
Kegan Wesley
Yeah, I said that wrong, Ted.
0:59:50.4 --> 0:59:51.324
Kegan Wesley
How? What is it?
0:59:51.884 --> 0:59:54.284
Kegan Wesley
An offer that makes people feel stupid for saying no.
0:59:54.284 --> 0:59:55.324
Kegan Wesley
Or how do you say it?
0:59:55.224 --> 0:59:57.184
Ted Ennenbach
No, no, exactly. Yeah, yeah.
0:59:56.804 --> 0:59:58.284
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that's it.
0:59:59.254 --> 1:0:9.534
Basement
Yeah, I think we can personally comb through like these different forms and stuff, clean up verbiage, clean up prices, membership defined memberships and stuff like that for sure.
1:0:9.304 --> 1:0:9.624
Luis Escobar
Perfect.
1:0:11.14 --> 1:0:20.214
Luis Escobar
Yeah, if I get my hands on that as soon as possible, I can really refine it and and really, you know, bring this website to life. I wanted to focus on these lead magnets first.
1:0:22.14 --> 1:0:25.214
Luis Escobar
You know the the the visuals, what you see, it's gonna look better.
1:0:25.214 --> 1:0:31.534
Luis Escobar
It doesn't look bad now, but like it's it'll get refined, especially once we throw in some like high quality.
1:0:33.94 --> 1:0:34.294
Luis Escobar
Imagery in there or videos.
1:0:36.294 --> 1:0:41.974
Luis Escobar
But yeah, so that just to keep continuing, we we just covered the membership options.
1:0:42.604 --> 1:0:45.764
Luis Escobar
Now we also have here the optimal health assessment.
1:0:48.574 --> 1:0:56.974
Luis Escobar
Right, that's that 599 package and it's just this is essentially supposed to be a dedicated, you know, asset that that we can put on any landing page.
1:0:58.784 --> 1:1:1.424
Luis Escobar
Kind of goes into what it is and what you're getting.
1:1:2.324 --> 1:1:4.124
Basement
Yeah, that, that one.
1:1:4.124 --> 1:1:11.804
Basement
We really price it at 599 specifically to compare it to the telehealth membership to make people like, OK.
1:1:11.844 --> 1:1:16.844
Basement
I'm like, you get in the as part of your telehealth membership, you get this assessment included.
1:1:17.324 --> 1:1:22.604
Basement
So the the idea was OK, make this really expensive so that they just go ahead and buy the membership.
1:1:17.754 --> 1:1:18.234
Luis Escobar
Gotcha.
1:1:22.804 --> 1:1:26.404
Basement
But normally when we offer this in office, it's like 199 so.
1:1:27.284 --> 1:1:27.724
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:1:28.164 --> 1:1:29.124
Luis Escobar
Oh yeah. Good deal.
1:1:29.164 --> 1:1:31.44
Luis Escobar
I mean, we can, you know, still play with that.
1:1:31.44 --> 1:1:33.164
Luis Escobar
It's it's a. Yeah, it's a.
1:1:33.164 --> 1:1:35.4
Luis Escobar
Is it called a decoy?
1:1:40.464 --> 1:1:42.24
Luis Escobar
Every product line should have a decoy.
1:1:44.484 --> 1:1:55.284
Basement
Yeah, I don't know personally if I like. If I agree with not wanting people to book the health assessment first, I don't know.
1:2:2.564 --> 1:2:2.924
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:2:2.994 --> 1:2:7.74
Basement
Opportunity after the patient has already seen the story, had an appointment.
1:2:7.74 --> 1:2:7.594
Basement
See what?
1:2:7.594 --> 1:2:8.834
Basement
What value we can offer?
1:2:8.834 --> 1:2:13.474
Basement
I feel like that's better, but you know, that's probably a bigger discussion than for right now.
1:2:13.314 --> 1:2:13.794
Luis Escobar
I hear you.
1:2:14.674 --> 1:2:15.154
Luis Escobar
I hear you.
1:2:15.554 --> 1:2:20.194
Luis Escobar
I mean, you know you you could put it. MSRP is 599, no.
1:2:20.314 --> 1:2:22.794
Luis Escobar
And then if they land on the website and then.
1:2:21.194 --> 1:2:28.874
Ted Ennenbach
Life life Force already does that. Life Force basically says 599 for the assessment.
1:2:28.954 --> 1:2:42.994
Ted Ennenbach
Or they just say go ahead and join. Join Now and they basically knock it all off and and just say it's a, you know, monthly charge of X3 month guarantee cancelling time so.
1:2:41.894 --> 1:2:42.94
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:2:44.344 --> 1:2:44.544
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:2:44.924 --> 1:2:45.404
Ted Ennenbach
So.
1:2:48.194 --> 1:2:53.794
Luis Escobar
Oh yeah, we should if they're doing it, we should too. Let's not kid ourselves.
1:2:56.84 --> 1:2:58.924
Luis Escobar
I like how they're showing that discount.
1:2:58.924 --> 1:3:2.804
Luis Escobar
You know it's it's actually 599, but if you act now, it's 349.
1:3:4.444 --> 1:3:4.524
Luis Escobar
Oh.
1:3:6.834 --> 1:3:8.754
Luis Escobar
And then the optimal health assessment.
1:3:8.754 --> 1:3:21.274
Luis Escobar
Yeah. So it can be 599 and the first time you land on the website, you're, you know, you see it at 599 and then seven days later, we hit you with the weekend discount for for 199 or or 1:49.
1:3:21.924 --> 1:3:22.324
Basement
Yep.
1:3:27.314 --> 1:3:30.114
Luis Escobar
Next one here is the smart booking system.
1:3:30.354 --> 1:3:39.754
Luis Escobar
The idea here is to just have a way to like streamline the the booking system and to make it a two step approach, right?
1:3:39.754 --> 1:3:50.274
Luis Escobar
So let's say I'm interested in medical consultation. I wanna get the hormone optimization consultation that instantly drags me down here.
1:3:50.274 --> 1:3:53.674
Luis Escobar
All I gotta do is now enter my name, e-mail, phone number.
1:3:54.404 --> 1:3:56.564
Luis Escobar
As soon as I submit, it's gonna take me to the.
1:3:58.74 --> 1:4:1.594
Luis Escobar
The booking form that's connected to our HubSpot check out.
1:4:3.624 --> 1:4:5.344
Luis Escobar
That's that's a simple idea there.
1:4:10.14 --> 1:4:10.534
Luis Escobar
So.
1:4:11.794 --> 1:4:14.634
Luis Escobar
Does anyone book multiple services?
1:4:18.144 --> 1:4:34.64
Basement
No, not since we've added the the No show fee, but that was something I wanted to add into like yeah, if you like, book your appointment, you get like either buy a membership or book another appointment and a link to our site but.
1:4:23.194 --> 1:4:23.714
Luis Escobar
All right.
1:4:34.574 --> 1:4:36.214
Kegan Wesley
What do you what do you mean by that though?
1:4:36.534 --> 1:4:44.14
Kegan Wesley
Some people would book a Hydra facial appointment with the esthetician and then book a Botox appointment after they're Hydra. Facial is that.
1:4:44.14 --> 1:4:46.774
Kegan Wesley
What is that? What you meant by your question? Or do you mean something different?
1:4:47.24 --> 1:4:50.544
Luis Escobar
Yeah, basically like and how does that affect the calendar?
1:4:50.544 --> 1:4:59.184
Luis Escobar
So if I want a hydrofacial and it's gonna last 45 minutes and then I also wanna get the dice board treatment that's gonna take 30 minutes.
1:5:0.644 --> 1:5:2.804
Luis Escobar
How should the logic work?
1:5:3.974 --> 1:5:4.134
Kegan Wesley
OK.
1:5:4.444 --> 1:5:4.764
Luis Escobar
In the calendar.
1:5:5.514 --> 1:5:14.274
Kegan Wesley
On online booking, I'm not sure when we with aesthetics, at least at springhurst, we get a lot of people that call and book.
1:5:14.834 --> 1:5:15.514
Kegan Wesley
We just.
1:5:15.514 --> 1:5:16.714
Kegan Wesley
We just do that for them.
1:5:18.844 --> 1:5:21.124
Kegan Wesley
I guess what Steven helped me, they would.
1:5:21.124 --> 1:5:24.524
Kegan Wesley
They would need to so if they were to book a hydrofacial with.
1:5:22.624 --> 1:5:24.184
Basement
Yeah, this is.
1:5:24.184 --> 1:5:26.24
Basement
This is a big yeah.
1:5:26.304 --> 1:5:34.544
Basement
So what they would see is they would go and book a yeah hydrofacial with Hayley and then they would have to go like and click like a filler appointment.
1:5:36.4 --> 1:5:46.164
Basement
If they wanted, like if they want to book another, yeah, they go back and see at that clinic what times are open for that appointment. The thing is, it gets tricky is like.
1:5:39.304 --> 1:5:39.504
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:5:40.484 --> 1:5:40.844
Kegan Wesley
Do it again.
1:5:47.884 --> 1:5:51.604
Basement
They're like the example you gave is like facial versus Botox.
1:5:51.914 --> 1:6:0.634
Basement
Are two different providers like one is an esthetician, one's an injector, so there's no really no way for us to show like OK.
1:5:53.874 --> 1:5:54.234
Luis Escobar
Oh.
1:6:0.634 --> 1:6:1.994
Basement
What's the time then?
1:6:1.994 --> 1:6:3.994
Basement
Both of those slots are open back-to-back.
1:6:4.214 --> 1:6:6.494
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah. Perfect. Cool.
1:6:5.524 --> 1:6:6.244
Basement
That's that's been.
1:6:5.764 --> 1:6:6.244
Ted Ennenbach
You haven't.
1:6:6.494 --> 1:6:15.494
Luis Escobar
Like for me, I'm thinking perfect world scenario is like if I pick only one hydrofacial and it says I can pick it at 3:00 PM then I pick it.
1:6:15.494 --> 1:6:25.974
Luis Escobar
But if I pick hydrofacial and Botox treatment, 3:00 PM is no longer available because now my I need to be there for an hour and 15 minutes.
1:6:25.974 --> 1:6:29.214
Luis Escobar
So it's gonna say recommend that I do the 6:00 PM slots.
1:6:30.234 --> 1:6:31.634
Basement
Yeah, that has been.
1:6:31.704 --> 1:6:46.224
Basement
That is why we do not offer PRP micro needling on for online booking, except that springhurst where they book it through not open dental because it requires a lab draw on one or a blood draw on one provider's calendar.
1:6:46.294 --> 1:6:49.814
Basement
And then the actual treatment on the other provider.
1:6:49.814 --> 1:6:52.934
Basement
So we there's no way to like check both appointments.
1:6:51.24 --> 1:6:58.584
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, but those two, yeah. Yeah. But that one procedure or that one thing requires two different.
1:7:0.844 --> 1:7:2.244
Ted Ennenbach
Providers what?
1:7:2.244 --> 1:7:18.844
Ted Ennenbach
What I do do like and I think where he's going is, you know, when you buy some something on like Amazon, you know, once you've bought it, it says, you know, people like you that have bought this also were interested in these other things.
1:7:19.754 --> 1:7:28.354
Ted Ennenbach
And so it immediately gives you three other options that that wouldn't be contraindicated for same day.
1:7:30.4 --> 1:7:39.164
Ted Ennenbach
Or or are often times by by people like them, you know, maybe not for the same day, but for the next day or for that next week or whatever.
1:7:31.224 --> 1:7:31.384
Basement
I go.
1:7:38.4 --> 1:7:38.124
Luis Escobar
MMM.
1:7:39.204 --> 1:7:44.484
Ted Ennenbach
So then then they go ahead and say, Oh yeah, I need need that too, so.
1:7:44.264 --> 1:7:45.104
Luis Escobar
I like that.
1:7:46.124 --> 1:7:46.284
Ted Ennenbach
That.
1:7:47.594 --> 1:7:59.884
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it'd be cool if, like, I can if I add the more I add. If I add three items, I get. If I add 2 items, I get 5% off. If I add three items, I guess 7% off, I get 5 items, I get 10%.
1:7:59.884 --> 1:7:59.994
Luis Escobar
Off.
1:8:2.514 --> 1:8:3.874
Luis Escobar
And then I pay.
1:8:3.914 --> 1:8:9.834
Luis Escobar
And then I basically have to complete five different calendar appointment bookies.
1:8:10.514 --> 1:8:14.34
Kegan Wesley
And that might even be a really great idea to be able to cross sell.
1:8:11.364 --> 1:8:11.564
Luis Escobar
Right.
1:8:15.684 --> 1:8:17.204
Kegan Wesley
Optimal health and aesthetic.
1:8:17.204 --> 1:8:20.444
Kegan Wesley
So if they book their optimal health consultation.
1:8:21.924 --> 1:8:33.684
Kegan Wesley
For a certain time and then you know, if you if you need Botox to schedule it 30 minutes after your console and you get 10% off like it would be really great to be able to cross sell that or if you're coming in for Botox, have you?
1:8:33.684 --> 1:8:37.964
Kegan Wesley
Thought about hormone optimization, if you, you know, do you get a free health assessment?
1:8:37.964 --> 1:8:38.484
Kegan Wesley
Whatever it may be.
1:8:39.674 --> 1:8:39.874
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:8:40.884 --> 1:8:48.284
Ted Ennenbach
Again, again, that's an excellent idea. If you know their age, you can really tailor this to them.
1:8:47.464 --> 1:8:47.704
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:8:48.524 --> 1:8:52.804
Ted Ennenbach
So, for example, 22 year old, 23 year old Olivia.
1:8:54.724 --> 1:8:57.564
Ted Ennenbach
Whitlock, she's getting five different.
1:8:58.834 --> 1:8:58.954
Basement
2.
1:8:59.814 --> 1:9:8.214
Ted Ennenbach
Peptides. She's taking five different peptides for her skin for her hair, for her nails.
1:9:6.354 --> 1:9:6.714
Basement
Just like.
1:9:8.214 --> 1:9:14.174
Ted Ennenbach
So I mean, this is where medical meets beauty and aesthetics and and.
1:9:15.844 --> 1:9:25.4
Ted Ennenbach
She she she's an influencer for us, but I had no clue that she was so heavily into the medical side. Because she's 23, you know.
1:9:25.84 --> 1:9:28.244
Ted Ennenbach
But if you look at her, you're like, well, OK, something's working.
1:9:25.854 --> 1:9:26.54
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:9:29.114 --> 1:9:30.234
Ted Ennenbach
So you know.
1:9:30.734 --> 1:9:32.414
Basement
Hey, Luis and Ted real quick.
1:9:32.454 --> 1:9:36.494
Basement
Steven has to run, but in terms of the data migration and stuff like that.
1:9:37.984 --> 1:9:39.864
Basement
Steve, you you kind of know your running point on that.
1:9:39.864 --> 1:9:40.744
Basement
Yeah. I just.
1:9:40.784 --> 1:9:45.904
Basement
I sent your team's message with the MINDBODY Developer Account login.
1:9:46.264 --> 1:9:50.384
Basement
Let me know if you need anything else from that and then I also put the most recent.
1:9:52.64 --> 1:9:53.384
Basement
Full MINDBODY dump that.
1:9:53.384 --> 1:9:56.464
Basement
We got in that database dump folder that I shared with you.
1:9:56.464 --> 1:9:57.984
Luis Escobar
Perfect. Perfect.
1:9:57.984 --> 1:9:59.984
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'll do. Again. Awesome. Thank you.
1:10:0.704 --> 1:10:5.144
Ted Ennenbach
Louis, what else is imperative that we go over, right, right now?
1:10:5.184 --> 1:10:7.64
Ted Ennenbach
I know it's 5530.
1:10:6.104 --> 1:10:9.744
Luis Escobar
Yeah. So yeah, just it's it's data.
1:10:9.744 --> 1:10:29.84
Luis Escobar
It's really about data, even what we're looking at right now, all these different products, the descriptions, the precise prices, the precise duration of times, if I can have that, you know, given to me in like a a spreadsheet that has all the accurate information. I derive this by.
1:10:29.224 --> 1:10:32.64
Luis Escobar
Extracting it from the current website and HubSpot.
1:10:33.484 --> 1:10:40.284
Luis Escobar
And but yeah, basically we need some quality assurance on all the different products, all the different services.
1:10:40.554 --> 1:10:44.74
Luis Escobar
All the different prices, all the different various memberships.
1:10:44.954 --> 1:10:49.394
Luis Escobar
Any insight you can, you know, provide me with like you know.
1:10:51.644 --> 1:10:53.524
Luis Escobar
What kind of customer?
1:10:52.364 --> 1:11:0.924
Basement
I'll send you all the fee schedules from open medical. They have all the prices, all the all the programs, all the products we sell, yeah.
1:11:0.24 --> 1:11:0.384
Luis Escobar
Got it.
1:11:1.884 --> 1:11:6.564
Luis Escobar
So yeah, all of these are going to be individual skews inside of Whocommerce and HubSpot.
1:11:8.484 --> 1:11:11.124
Luis Escobar
So yeah, if I can get that, that would be very helpful.
1:11:12.514 --> 1:11:17.514
Basement
Get that to you on Monday, early or maybe this weekend if I can have some time.
1:11:16.644 --> 1:11:16.844
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:11:17.674 --> 1:11:26.194
Basement
It's also I feel like I should mention the fee schedules that related to procedure codes for each product, so that could kind of act as a SKU at some point.
1:11:27.644 --> 1:11:31.364
Basement
They're they're coded in a way where it says a lot about the product like.
1:11:33.324 --> 1:11:34.764
Basement
Excuse me, the manufacturer.
1:11:33.764 --> 1:11:33.964
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:11:34.764 --> 1:11:41.244
Basement
How frequently it's supposed to be used, like how frequently the renewal is or like, how when it's supposed to run out, basically.
1:11:42.914 --> 1:11:48.154
Basement
Other things like whether it's an aesthetic versus medical, whether it's a supplement, that type of stuff.
1:11:48.154 --> 1:11:50.554
Basement
So that could be useful in some ways too.
1:11:49.404 --> 1:11:49.804
Luis Escobar
Gotcha.
1:11:51.914 --> 1:11:52.674
Luis Escobar
Awesome. Awesome.
1:11:54.544 --> 1:11:55.144
Basement
Thank you.
1:11:55.144 --> 1:11:58.184
Basement
Sorry everyone, you all have a good weekend.
1:11:56.54 --> 1:11:57.614
Luis Escobar
Yeah, all good.
1:11:57.894 --> 1:12:1.414
Luis Escobar
Again, this is actually like the last thing I wanted to share.
1:12:1.414 --> 1:12:4.894
Luis Escobar
Here is the what this is called the products and supplement store.
1:12:4.964 --> 1:12:8.644
Luis Escobar
So essentially the idea here that you can come and a la carte.
1:12:12.514 --> 1:12:14.834
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, we we would have a header called.
1:12:17.94 --> 1:12:17.974
Ted Ennenbach
Peptides as well.
1:12:18.464 --> 1:12:18.864
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:12:19.534 --> 1:12:19.614
Ted Ennenbach
So.
1:12:20.374 --> 1:12:21.854
Luis Escobar
So I got my total here.
1:12:21.934 --> 1:12:22.814
Luis Escobar
I just checked out.
1:12:26.554 --> 1:12:26.754
Kegan Wesley
Cool.
1:12:27.534 --> 1:12:31.894
Luis Escobar
Each of these deserve, like their own high quality image in them. So that's another thing, right?
1:12:31.894 --> 1:12:37.414
Luis Escobar
Regarding, you know, providing me with all the accurate names and descriptions and prices.
1:12:38.814 --> 1:12:45.774
Luis Escobar
If we can get started also on just picking out images that we want to use on, on Shutterstock or any other.
1:12:48.784 --> 1:12:50.344
Luis Escobar
Stock photography provider.
1:12:51.814 --> 1:12:55.894
Luis Escobar
That that also helped move the needle forward so so that the website can come to life faster.
1:12:59.604 --> 1:13:10.164
Luis Escobar
But also the idea of like being able to fine tune the membership for the right person. If if someone could, you know, put some notes on just how that should look and share that with me.
1:13:12.214 --> 1:13:18.294
Luis Escobar
If somebody clicks, if somebody responds to this answer and this answer, they should be guided in this direction.
1:13:20.74 --> 1:13:20.514
Ted Ennenbach
OK.
1:13:21.364 --> 1:13:22.724
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that would be helpful for me.
1:13:23.954 --> 1:13:28.954
Basement
For medical would probably be kind of tranches of ages, but yeah, we can.
1:13:28.994 --> 1:13:29.714
Basement
We can spell that out.
1:13:31.474 --> 1:13:31.834
Luis Escobar
David.
1:13:37.424 --> 1:13:39.24
Luis Escobar
And yeah, those are, you know, these are.
1:13:41.54 --> 1:13:43.614
Luis Escobar
7 assets essentially right that the website's gonna be using.
1:13:45.374 --> 1:13:46.574
Luis Escobar
Different parts of it.
1:13:55.834 --> 1:13:55.954
Luis Escobar
Umm.
1:14:2.114 --> 1:14:19.154
Luis Escobar
Yeah, the the immediate thing that I'm gonna be focusing on for the next 4872 hours is the data. I'm gonna start just preparing the object and the field and sharing those notes with Steven and looking for that. We got everything you need so we can.
1:14:19.154 --> 1:14:20.674
Luis Escobar
Proceed with the migration next week.
1:14:21.354 --> 1:14:22.354
Basement
That's perfect.
1:14:23.814 --> 1:14:28.534
Basement
What, in terms of the click up task and other things you can delegate to our team members?
1:14:30.294 --> 1:14:30.774
Basement
What is that?
1:14:30.894 --> 1:14:32.494
Basement
What is that looking like 'cause? It's great.
1:14:32.494 --> 1:14:33.334
Basement
You have a clear focus.
1:14:33.334 --> 1:14:37.934
Basement
I just want to make sure everybody on our team is doing what needs to be done.
1:14:39.454 --> 1:14:41.654
Basement
Alongside what you're doing, not double work.
1:14:41.654 --> 1:14:42.774
Basement
Not whatever it may be.
1:14:41.714 --> 1:14:42.354
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:14:43.854 --> 1:14:44.934
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, I agree.
1:14:45.254 --> 1:14:46.814
Luis Escobar
I mean, let's let's cover.
1:14:46.854 --> 1:14:47.934
Luis Escobar
Let's go over. Click up now.
1:15:37.844 --> 1:15:38.804
Luis Escobar
All right, here we go.
1:15:42.614 --> 1:15:47.774
Luis Escobar
Yes, I had this one right here right notices task.
1:16:1.4 --> 1:16:4.204
Luis Escobar
This one right here, 6/16 to 6/29.
1:16:7.304 --> 1:16:8.624
Basement
Yeah, that's the current one.
1:16:9.424 --> 1:16:10.624
Luis Escobar
The current one, OK.
1:16:12.464 --> 1:16:13.104
Luis Escobar
Yeah, let's.
1:16:13.104 --> 1:16:16.224
Luis Escobar
I mean, I know there's a lot of things going on here.
1:16:16.224 --> 1:16:21.704
Luis Escobar
I haven't really wrapped my mind around all of them, so I just want to, I guess, take it from the top.
1:16:24.874 --> 1:16:25.474
Luis Escobar
Create.
1:16:27.524 --> 1:16:28.644
Luis Escobar
Community flowers.
1:16:32.404 --> 1:16:33.884
Luis Escobar
I'll pop that up from the ad.
1:16:36.174 --> 1:16:37.14
Luis Escobar
What is this hub?
1:16:37.14 --> 1:16:38.454
Luis Escobar
Spot data from ads.
1:16:41.44 --> 1:16:43.924
Basement
The lead magnets are. I didn't.
1:16:44.324 --> 1:16:45.124
Basement
I didn't make that.
1:16:47.974 --> 1:16:49.254
Basement
Just on it, Brian.
1:16:53.624 --> 1:17:0.64
Luis Escobar
The appointment system, I understand there's some issues there with the the way it works and functions, right?
1:17:1.534 --> 1:17:4.974
Luis Escobar
I mean that that's gonna be resolved as soon as I implement the new booking system.
1:17:8.94 --> 1:17:8.214
Renzo Mogrovejo
Umm.
1:17:8.534 --> 1:17:8.654
Luis Escobar
Umm.
1:17:10.244 --> 1:17:12.484
Renzo Mogrovejo
Most most of them we are.
1:17:12.924 --> 1:17:14.524
Renzo Mogrovejo
We still have some.
1:17:16.774 --> 1:17:20.534
Renzo Mogrovejo
Issues in in the logic that we have because.
1:17:21.934 --> 1:17:25.94
Renzo Mogrovejo
Currently not on my, not on my body.
1:17:27.934 --> 1:17:28.214
Renzo Mogrovejo
But on.
1:17:30.454 --> 1:17:34.294
Renzo Mogrovejo
We have the limitation that we don't have.
1:17:35.814 --> 1:17:39.574
Renzo Mogrovejo
More than one calendar or availability?
1:17:40.234 --> 1:17:41.154
Renzo Mogrovejo
Per clinic.
1:17:42.654 --> 1:17:43.774
Renzo Mogrovejo
Of of one provider.
1:17:45.494 --> 1:17:47.414
Renzo Mogrovejo
So for example, if I am busy.
1:17:45.994 --> 1:17:46.194
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:17:49.334 --> 1:17:50.94
Renzo Mogrovejo
On peer Creek.
1:17:51.934 --> 1:17:55.574
Renzo Mogrovejo
But I should be available on springhurst for example.
1:17:57.534 --> 1:18:1.694
Renzo Mogrovejo
And that scenario is we don't know.
1:18:4.654 --> 1:18:5.494
Renzo Mogrovejo
We can.
1:18:5.494 --> 1:18:9.494
Renzo Mogrovejo
We can tackle that scenario, but we we should spend more on HubSpot.
1:18:9.734 --> 1:18:11.14
Renzo Mogrovejo
But maybe we can.
1:18:12.694 --> 1:18:14.494
Renzo Mogrovejo
Share some of some idea with you.
1:18:14.924 --> 1:18:15.444
Renzo Mogrovejo
So.
1:18:16.604 --> 1:18:27.564
Luis Escobar
Yeah, my, my I'm gonna make use of the HubSpot booking system and I'm also gonna make use of a a custom booking system that I'm gonna build for us on top of WordPress.
1:18:16.894 --> 1:18:18.14
Renzo Mogrovejo
We can switch the case.
1:18:29.54 --> 1:18:37.294
Luis Escobar
With the the one on top of WordPress, I'm gonna have a lot more flexibility. I'm gonna be able to send and receive web hooks, for example.
1:18:40.364 --> 1:18:54.284
Luis Escobar
So just just a simple webhook will solve the problem in, in or in terms of like having to I guess hire someone or from your show or or send a signal to to help saw or even to OM.
1:18:56.994 --> 1:19:3.34
Renzo Mogrovejo
Fantastic. Yeah, because right now we depend on the availability that we got.
1:19:4.494 --> 1:19:14.294
Renzo Mogrovejo
Outlook calendar because we have connected all the providers outlook calendar with HubSpot so.
1:19:16.214 --> 1:19:19.974
Renzo Mogrovejo
Whatever availability you have on those calendars is what you can book.
1:19:22.94 --> 1:19:22.654
Renzo Mogrovejo
So.
1:19:22.134 --> 1:19:25.14
Luis Escobar
Perfect. That's. That's the best way to do it.
1:19:26.534 --> 1:19:28.94
Luis Escobar
So every provider has their own.
1:19:28.94 --> 1:19:29.854
Luis Escobar
Everyone has an enu e-mail.
1:19:30.894 --> 1:19:31.454
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yeah.
1:19:32.564 --> 1:19:33.124
Luis Escobar
OK, perfect.
1:19:32.844 --> 1:19:35.44
Renzo Mogrovejo
And we have like a master account.
1:19:36.214 --> 1:19:36.414
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:19:36.534 --> 1:19:37.734
Renzo Mogrovejo
In which we can access.
1:19:40.14 --> 1:19:41.974
Renzo Mogrovejo
To to view or edit the.
1:19:43.894 --> 1:19:55.14
Renzo Mogrovejo
The events that are created through the integrate Sapir that is updates at enia.co. I can grant you access after this meeting.
1:19:54.584 --> 1:19:55.304
Luis Escobar
Yeah, please.
1:19:56.84 --> 1:19:56.524
Renzo Mogrovejo
Yeah.
1:19:57.394 --> 1:19:57.994
Luis Escobar
OK, great.
1:20:3.874 --> 1:20:3.994
Luis Escobar
Umm.
1:20:5.884 --> 1:20:7.244
Luis Escobar
Yeah, data migration.
1:20:9.54 --> 1:20:13.734
Luis Escobar
Integration for operations? Yeah, air call. I I I know we got it already.
1:20:15.454 --> 1:20:20.734
Luis Escobar
I I sent the message to the company called Project Blue.
1:20:20.734 --> 1:20:27.534
Luis Escobar
They're the ones that are gonna get us the iMessage capability. I think that's also I'm already getting, like really good results from.
1:20:29.294 --> 1:20:30.894
Luis Escobar
Where the other projects that I'm using it on.
1:20:33.744 --> 1:20:36.624
Luis Escobar
People seem more responsive to when they see a blue message, you know.
1:20:38.694 --> 1:20:39.294
Basement
For sure.
1:20:44.294 --> 1:20:46.94
Luis Escobar
And then I see here social.
1:20:49.364 --> 1:20:49.484
Ted Ennenbach
And.
1:20:50.404 --> 1:20:54.204
Basement
Those you don't need to worry about Marissa's on top of those.
1:20:55.24 --> 1:20:56.24
Luis Escobar
OK, great.
1:20:55.124 --> 1:20:56.524
Basement
Yeah, those are just, yeah.
1:20:59.164 --> 1:21:0.564
Ted Ennenbach
Where do we need support?
1:21:0.564 --> 1:21:3.164
Ted Ennenbach
Do do do we need support on web design?
1:21:3.244 --> 1:21:8.524
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, do we getting the third party involved in the word WordPress site?
1:21:10.54 --> 1:21:12.214
Ted Ennenbach
Or we're ready for that yet.
1:21:10.144 --> 1:21:10.264
Luis Escobar
Umm.
1:21:13.734 --> 1:21:31.294
Luis Escobar
As soon as I have the WordPress site up and running, I'm gonna. I'm gonna have like the the main pages built out, right? But then the inner pages, all those like every product, essentially every service should have its own like full-fledged landing page. That is really well.
1:21:31.294 --> 1:21:31.894
Luis Escobar
Thought out.
1:21:32.964 --> 1:21:41.524
Luis Escobar
That process, yeah, we we wanna bring someone into to just basically, you know, fine tune all those inner pages, all those inner landing pages.
1:21:45.84 --> 1:21:45.524
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:21:46.514 --> 1:21:49.874
Luis Escobar
And then on the graphic and visual.
1:21:48.254 --> 1:21:50.934
Ted Ennenbach
I just wanted to this needs to look.
1:21:51.134 --> 1:21:53.934
Ted Ennenbach
This needs to look like a national brand.
1:21:53.934 --> 1:21:58.254
Ted Ennenbach
It needs to be designer brand level, you know so.
1:22:1.464 --> 1:22:2.824
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we'll achieve that.
1:22:5.124 --> 1:22:8.324
Luis Escobar
It has a lot to do with the the imagery, right?
1:22:8.394 --> 1:22:9.74
Luis Escobar
It's a big deal.
1:22:8.884 --> 1:22:9.284
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:22:9.144 --> 1:22:10.904
Luis Escobar
So like let's.
1:22:11.304 --> 1:22:14.424
Luis Escobar
I mean, all hands on deck whenever you see a good image, just save it.
1:22:15.994 --> 1:22:16.634
Luis Escobar
Take a screenshot.
1:22:20.44 --> 1:22:20.884
Basement
Absolutely.
1:22:23.634 --> 1:22:34.274
Ted Ennenbach
Images that that are showing real folks in front of their computer on their phone with screenshots actually using the technology.
1:22:34.274 --> 1:22:42.994
Ted Ennenbach
You know, I mean showing that we have the biohacking availability and the tracking of one's health.
1:22:44.564 --> 1:22:47.684
Ted Ennenbach
I think that's hugely powerful so.
1:22:46.284 --> 1:22:46.804
Luis Escobar
Alright.
1:22:49.114 --> 1:22:59.314
Luis Escobar
Yeah, but also so that that reminds me on the in the last meeting you mentioned that you know there's this like large PDF that people receive when they complete their.
1:23:0.274 --> 1:23:0.754
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:23:1.374 --> 1:23:2.374
Luis Escobar
Consultation, right.
1:23:3.834 --> 1:23:7.594
Luis Escobar
But yeah, if I could get if you could share that with me, that'd be very helpful.
1:23:7.634 --> 1:23:12.674
Luis Escobar
'Cause what I'm thinking is that that essentially we're gonna convert that into the the digital version of that.
1:23:14.444 --> 1:23:15.84
Luis Escobar
Right.
1:23:15.544 --> 1:23:25.144
Basement
I can get you a copy of a of a. The story is what you're referring to, kind of the overview of the personal, the person's health that the provider goes through.
1:23:16.44 --> 1:23:16.164
Ted Ennenbach
Hi.
1:23:27.104 --> 1:23:27.944
Luis Escobar
Is that what it is?
1:23:27.944 --> 1:23:29.904
Luis Escobar
So OK.
1:23:28.404 --> 1:23:28.844
Basement
Yeah.
1:23:30.584 --> 1:23:32.144
Luis Escobar
So does that make sense?
1:23:30.664 --> 1:23:34.384
Ted Ennenbach
We we can actually do 1:00 we we can actually do one better.
1:23:34.464 --> 1:23:46.584
Ted Ennenbach
We can give you the mapping sequence that the Tableau database pulls, and so I mean we we could actually create that story however you want it.
1:23:46.584 --> 1:23:51.64
Ted Ennenbach
I mean we, we we can show you exactly how.
1:23:51.64 --> 1:23:54.824
Ted Ennenbach
It's mapped now page by by page and what it's pulling.
1:23:56.444 --> 1:23:59.484
Ted Ennenbach
But but that that doesn't mean that.
1:24:0.524 --> 1:24:11.4
Ted Ennenbach
It can't look better, you know, and especially if you're able to aggregate all of this data into one place, you know, I think it's huge so.
1:24:2.294 --> 1:24:2.854
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:24:10.974 --> 1:24:12.894
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I think that's this is.
1:24:12.894 --> 1:24:18.94
Luis Escobar
This is the foundation of this live score that we're thinking about, right?
1:24:20.604 --> 1:24:32.444
Basement
Just another comment, going back to the click up, I think we have two tasks on there that is data migration and integration and then integrate AI for operations.
1:24:33.844 --> 1:24:41.764
Basement
I think really we just like if there's if there's task that you have for our team to either.
1:24:35.404 --> 1:24:35.844
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:24:43.484 --> 1:24:44.164
Basement
Let Brian know.
1:24:44.164 --> 1:24:49.804
Basement
Or I mean you could add them under those sub tasks. I think overall we.
1:24:47.344 --> 1:24:47.864
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:24:50.94 --> 1:24:50.454
Ted Ennenbach
Excellent.
1:24:50.154 --> 1:24:59.474
Basement
Just like had we put those two on there to start so we can start to begin the process and I think we just need to let our team know where they need to start.
1:24:56.194 --> 1:24:56.394
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:24:59.474 --> 1:25:1.274
Basement
I think Steven got a good idea today.
1:25:2.724 --> 1:25:11.284
Basement
From what you guys were talking about earlier, but yeah, overall I think it's just organizing those two sub tasks to get started on everything.
1:25:6.294 --> 1:25:6.894
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:25:11.284 --> 1:25:14.84
Basement
So I think that's it with click up really.
1:25:15.254 --> 1:25:16.494
Luis Escobar
Gotcha. Gotcha.
1:25:17.894 --> 1:25:23.14
Luis Escobar
Yeah, for sure. I'll, I'll add my you know my notes in there regarding what's next, but.
1:25:23.774 --> 1:25:24.254
Basement
OK.
1:25:27.464 --> 1:25:33.584
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, I mean, is that what you're saying is for him to prioritize?
1:25:36.364 --> 1:25:36.764
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:25:36.584 --> 1:25:38.784
Basement
Just kind of saying where he needs us to start.
1:25:39.214 --> 1:25:40.534
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1:25:40.694 --> 1:25:41.934
Luis Escobar
Yeah, like to the.
1:25:40.834 --> 1:25:41.514
Basement
We have.
1:25:43.644 --> 1:25:43.724
Basement
To.
1:25:44.34 --> 1:25:44.714
Basement
Sorry, go ahead.
1:25:45.264 --> 1:25:51.624
Luis Escobar
I was just gonna say, like today we kind of like established that Steven will assist on the on the object creation, right.
1:25:51.664 --> 1:25:54.104
Luis Escobar
We just needed to map out what those objects are.
1:25:55.54 --> 1:25:55.494
Basement
Yeah.
1:25:55.634 --> 1:26:0.674
Luis Escobar
I still need to go through that MINDBODY. You know, export and make sure we're not missing anything.
1:26:0.874 --> 1:26:2.34
Luis Escobar
But yeah, I think we got.
1:26:3.814 --> 1:26:4.814
Luis Escobar
Write the game plan down.
1:26:6.384 --> 1:26:6.904
Basement
Perfect.
1:26:9.524 --> 1:26:17.364
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah. In the meantime, if anybody has any idle time, I mean, I guesswork raise their hand, you know.
1:26:19.4 --> 1:26:20.204
Ted Ennenbach
I'm not sure.
1:26:20.204 --> 1:26:24.44
Ted Ennenbach
I assume you're keeping Theo busy and Ilda busy.
1:26:25.724 --> 1:26:26.364
Basement
Yes.
1:26:32.294 --> 1:26:33.614
Brian Hyatt
I can definitely.
1:26:32.604 --> 1:26:33.844
Luis Escobar
Also all the.
1:26:35.204 --> 1:26:36.164
Brian Hyatt
Oh, sorry, we can definitely.
1:26:37.844 --> 1:26:40.844
Brian Hyatt
Tap seamena if we need some extra hands on some things.
1:26:40.844 --> 1:26:50.44
Brian Hyatt
I know she's staying busy, but I would say if there's anybody that could fit some time in, we could definitely get her to help out and she has.
1:26:43.514 --> 1:26:43.714
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:26:50.204 --> 1:26:51.484
Brian Hyatt
She has an experience.
1:26:52.704 --> 1:26:53.144
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:26:53.364 --> 1:26:54.604
Brian Hyatt
With HubSpot and everything.
1:26:54.604 --> 1:26:55.844
Brian Hyatt
So she would be a really good resource.
1:26:56.664 --> 1:26:57.624
Luis Escobar
OK, OK.
1:27:0.64 --> 1:27:7.624
Luis Escobar
And yet, if you guys can just go through those links for all those different assets and just give feedback wherever you have any feedback?
1:27:10.414 --> 1:27:21.654
Luis Escobar
That that would be helpful. Yeah. As soon as the new, you know, this new site with all this new assets goes live, they're definitely gonna be, you know, more more work to pass around.
1:27:11.954 --> 1:27:12.394
Basement
Will do.
1:27:25.594 --> 1:27:30.754
Luis Escobar
I I still also want to like do a deep dive into what ads are running right now.
1:27:35.704 --> 1:27:40.854
Brian Hyatt
So yeah, we can do a deep dive on that if you would like.
1:27:40.844 --> 1:27:48.184
Brian Hyatt
I I'm actually heading to my daughter's softball game, but I put in the chat if you have some time tomorrow, I'll definitely have some time tomorrow.
1:27:44.914 --> 1:27:45.314
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:27:48.904 --> 1:27:49.344
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:27:49.344 --> 1:27:55.24
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah. I just want to start wrapping my head around that and reason being just so that.
1:27:50.354 --> 1:27:52.314
Brian Hyatt
And and we can run through all that.
1:27:56.514 --> 1:28:2.514
Luis Escobar
The first few landing pages that we Polish or should be those the ones that are are getting traffic sent to them.
1:28:3.724 --> 1:28:9.764
Brian Hyatt
Yeah. And I can show you some of the some of the recent changes that we've done that seem to have been.
1:28:11.244 --> 1:28:19.84
Brian Hyatt
At least driving more leads for the MC as to be calling the past few days, so we can go over some of that as well.
1:28:20.244 --> 1:28:22.4
Luis Escobar
All right, follow it. Follow it.
1:28:27.744 --> 1:28:30.544
Luis Escobar
But yeah, I'm actually excited to get my hands on that.
1:28:32.434 --> 1:28:42.674
Luis Escobar
A story you guys call it, I think from from theirs where we're gonna build the foundation for like this digital experience, right, where where we can start comparing ourselves to live horse.
1:28:44.554 --> 1:29:3.324
Ted Ennenbach
So Trent Trent sent him a copy of the baseline story, the review story, and then also the provider dashboard that that is the two page summary of kind of where they started, where they've been, where they're at now and where they need to be or go to be.
1:29:3.324 --> 1:29:3.794
Ted Ennenbach
Optimal.
1:29:5.364 --> 1:29:8.764
Ted Ennenbach
That's that's all Pro pro programmed in.
1:29:10.444 --> 1:29:11.324
Ted Ennenbach
It it looks cool.
1:29:11.324 --> 1:29:11.844
Ted Ennenbach
It looks good.
1:29:11.844 --> 1:29:14.524
Ted Ennenbach
I mean it's it's literally like life force.
1:29:15.454 --> 1:29:22.334
Ted Ennenbach
I mean, because I started this when Ted Tedlow became available.
1:29:22.334 --> 1:29:27.174
Ted Ennenbach
So it's almost like life force literally copied what I did.
1:29:28.684 --> 1:29:31.44
Ted Ennenbach
Eight years ago, nine years ago.
1:29:31.84 --> 1:29:33.404
Ted Ennenbach
Except with a whole lot more money.
1:29:41.514 --> 1:29:42.754
Basement
I'll get that to him for sure.
1:29:43.864 --> 1:29:44.824
Luis Escobar
Awesome. Awesome.
1:29:49.714 --> 1:29:52.434
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that's that's really what's up of mind right now.
1:29:56.764 --> 1:29:58.84
Luis Escobar
There was one more thing.
1:29:58.84 --> 1:29:59.564
Luis Escobar
Oh yes, the stripe.
1:30:2.64 --> 1:30:5.184
Luis Escobar
Making sure that that we, you know, we have stripes up and running.
1:30:12.834 --> 1:30:14.114
Luis Escobar
Was there anything that need?
1:30:12.994 --> 1:30:13.394
Basement
Pedal.
1:30:14.714 --> 1:30:21.194
Luis Escobar
Was there anything that needed to be updated on the stripe account to make it active again or like still I think it's standing already?
1:30:23.64 --> 1:30:44.864
Ted Ennenbach
I think stripes in good standing for 25 again, it's not for Concordia practice management, which is what runs try, try tripods. They had a problem with tripods directly selling pharmaceuticals. So so I would need to solve that problem before.
1:30:23.834 --> 1:30:25.834
Brian Hyatt
The yeah.
1:30:46.284 --> 1:30:48.444
Ted Ennenbach
We can get that Stripe account going.
1:30:49.154 --> 1:30:50.474
Basement
That's down the road, probably.
1:30:51.384 --> 1:30:51.824
Ted Ennenbach
Yeah.
1:30:54.274 --> 1:30:56.834
Luis Escobar
I see.
1:30:56.704 --> 1:31:0.104
Ted Ennenbach
I think though, that I believe that Stripe is being used.
1:31:0.104 --> 1:31:8.944
Ted Ennenbach
I could be wrong, but if you go to 25again.com in the store there, I believe that they're Shopify.
1:31:9.264 --> 1:31:12.24
Ted Ennenbach
Shopify is using Stripe I think.
1:31:12.694 --> 1:31:21.854
Brian Hyatt
We and we are using stripe for the gift card purchases on a new so it we do have stripe actives.
1:31:12.944 --> 1:31:13.304
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:31:22.384 --> 1:31:23.424
Luis Escobar
We do OK.
1:31:22.444 --> 1:31:23.364
Ted Ennenbach
And that is that is.
1:31:24.444 --> 1:31:29.444
Ted Ennenbach
And those are FSA and HSA approved so.
1:31:30.684 --> 1:31:32.804
Luis Escobar
Perfect. So yeah, we'll just need to, I guess.
1:31:34.354 --> 1:31:38.754
Luis Escobar
Next week, sometime next week, we'll notify Stripe of the new domain new life.
1:31:40.874 --> 1:31:42.674
Luis Escobar
So that stripe can work on that domain.
1:31:47.684 --> 1:31:48.324
Basement
Part.
1:31:51.424 --> 1:31:52.704
Basement
I know what I need to do.
1:31:54.124 --> 1:31:54.444
Basement
You good?
1:31:56.84 --> 1:31:59.844
Basement
Anything else we can help you with? Any outstanding things?
1:32:3.794 --> 1:32:4.674
Luis Escobar
All good on my end.
1:32:4.674 --> 1:32:16.954
Luis Escobar
For now, I'll be sending emails and notes over the weekend and next week will be also a lot of things moving and shaking, but to it will be a good week.
1:32:17.24 --> 1:32:20.464
Luis Escobar
Next week we'll we should be able to make a lot of new systems live, actually.
1:32:22.524 --> 1:32:34.324
Basement
I have a limited availability tomorrow, but I'm going to do as much legwork on the tasks I said I would do on Sunday and try and try and see if I can get that to you before Monday. But Monday, Monday, late is for sure.
1:32:35.324 --> 1:32:35.964
Luis Escobar
That works.
1:32:35.534 --> 1:32:41.894
Ted Ennenbach
I assume you're limited availability is because you're cutting the grass and vaulted the yard.
1:32:42.414 --> 1:32:43.374
Basement
Absolutely, yeah.
1:32:43.374 --> 1:32:44.574
Basement
That's exactly what I'll be doing.
1:32:46.954 --> 1:32:47.74
Basement
Not.
1:32:49.374 --> 1:33:4.494
Brian Hyatt
And the only the only other thing I have is Louis, if you can share with me kind of and you can we can do it offline right now or anything, but just kind of an estimate of when do you think some of these things will launch so that?
1:33:4.494 --> 1:33:13.694
Brian Hyatt
We can align that with some of the changes and different things that we're working on for the marketing that we have going on. 'cause, I don't wanna you know.
1:33:14.394 --> 1:33:19.754
Brian Hyatt
Just do something on the current side. If we don't need to, because we're gonna be launching the new one.
1:33:14.504 --> 1:33:15.224
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:33:21.224 --> 1:33:26.144
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Let me put you know together on on a more accurate timeline, right.
1:33:26.624 --> 1:33:30.264
Luis Escobar
But I I want to put us in a position where we're not stalling or like this.
1:33:30.264 --> 1:33:31.544
Luis Escobar
You know, there's a lot of like.
1:33:33.34 --> 1:33:36.794
Luis Escobar
There's a chance that this data import might not go as smooth as I'm imagining it.
1:33:38.514 --> 1:33:42.74
Luis Escobar
And if that's the case, it's, you know, we're not gonna let that stop us.
1:33:39.254 --> 1:33:40.134
Brian Hyatt
Yeah, yeah.
1:33:42.74 --> 1:33:46.34
Luis Escobar
We can still, you know, do some proactive marketing starting next week.
1:33:43.914 --> 1:33:44.354
Brian Hyatt
Yeah.
1:33:47.924 --> 1:33:48.684
Brian Hyatt
Yeah, yeah.
1:33:48.684 --> 1:33:53.324
Brian Hyatt
And we're we're definitely hitting, hitting it pretty hard right now with some of the things we're doing.
1:33:53.324 --> 1:33:59.124
Brian Hyatt
So we just want to make sure that we're not going to duplicate anything if we don't need to.
1:33:58.474 --> 1:33:58.674
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:33:59.774 --> 1:34:0.494
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it makes sense.
1:34:7.434 --> 1:34:9.914
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Give me a over the weekend.
1:34:9.914 --> 1:34:13.874
Luis Escobar
I'll I'll share some notes on what I think is a really accurate projection.
1:34:15.234 --> 1:34:16.474
Brian Hyatt
OK, awesome.
1:34:23.184 --> 1:34:32.104
