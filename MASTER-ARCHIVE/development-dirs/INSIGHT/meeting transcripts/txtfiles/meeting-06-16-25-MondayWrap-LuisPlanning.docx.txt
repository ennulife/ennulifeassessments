0:0:12.365 --> 0:0:15.85
Basement
Is that a case of the one that, yeah, me too.
0:0:18.675 --> 0:0:20.875
Basement
I had case of the Mondays.
0:0:48.215 --> 0:0:49.215
Basement
Spring harbor.
0:0:52.645 --> 0:0:55.525
Basement
Is pride here? He's going to be in the meeting.
0:1:3.415 --> 0:1:4.655
Basement
How long is this supposed to be?
0:1:14.485 --> 0:1:15.725
Basement
I'm sure somebody trying.
0:1:16.685 --> 0:1:17.965
Basement
Yeah, I just heard that.
0:1:19.485 --> 0:1:19.845
Basement
There we go.
0:1:22.615 --> 0:1:23.55
Basement
Hello.
0:1:24.375 --> 0:1:25.95
Luis Escobar
Hi everyone.
0:1:28.705 --> 0:1:29.625
Basement
Happy Monday.
0:1:30.515 --> 0:1:31.515
Luis Escobar
Happy Monday.
0:1:32.125 --> 0:1:32.725
Luis Escobar
How's it going?
0:1:34.345 --> 0:1:37.345
Basement
Good, good. I think we're waiting for Brian.
0:1:37.385 --> 0:1:38.305
Basement
Or should we wait?
0:1:38.305 --> 0:1:39.505
Basement
Or he should be.
0:1:40.145 --> 0:1:41.865
Basement
Yeah, yeah. Let me text him real quick.
0:1:41.865 --> 0:1:42.545
Basement
He should be home.
0:1:47.255 --> 0:1:47.415
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:1:56.825 --> 0:2:0.225
Basement
Were you able to gain access to your e-mail?
0:2:0.715 --> 0:2:1.955
Luis Escobar
Yes, I did. Thank you for that.
0:2:2.815 --> 0:2:3.375
Basement
OK.
0:2:5.145 --> 0:2:5.385
Basement
OK.
0:2:7.185 --> 0:2:13.385
Basement
No. Yeah, there there is quite a bit of stuff that I sent to you.
0:2:15.105 --> 0:2:19.25
Basement
As well, I don't know if you all send anything to him as well, but Miro.
0:2:19.145 --> 0:2:19.905
Basement
Yeah, I see Miro.
0:2:19.945 --> 0:2:22.785
Basement
I sent a few Zapier.
0:2:23.585 --> 0:2:29.905
Basement
You should have gotten some from body side zoom on zip on zip was wondering. OK OK.
0:2:33.525 --> 0:2:35.525
Basement
So I sent a list of.
0:2:37.745 --> 0:2:39.265
Basement
Softwares I guess or.
0:2:39.405 --> 0:2:39.605
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:2:41.385 --> 0:2:47.425
Basement
That kind of thing and kind of assigned people to give you access to all that so.
0:2:49.105 --> 0:2:53.185
Basement
Hopefully, by tonight or tomorrow you'll you'll have everything.
0:2:54.395 --> 0:2:54.875
Luis Escobar
Perfect.
0:2:55.865 --> 0:2:56.705
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I see.
0:2:58.115 --> 0:3:3.155
Luis Escobar
Several different logins now and definitely the HubSpot one is the most important one right now.
0:3:5.155 --> 0:3:5.275
Luis Escobar
Umm.
0:3:11.805 --> 0:3:14.445
Basement
That that was Brian, I think, right.
0:3:15.975 --> 0:3:16.695
Basement
Think so?
0:3:18.305 --> 0:3:19.785
Basement
Did you get that or no?
0:3:21.315 --> 0:3:22.195
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I got that.
0:3:22.705 --> 0:3:24.305
Basement
OK, OK.
0:3:24.5 --> 0:3:24.205
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:3:26.185 --> 0:3:28.505
Basement
Otheo sciotch on site can I?
0:3:28.505 --> 0:3:29.745
Basement
Can I see that page?
0:3:29.745 --> 0:3:30.785
Basement
The one he sent out.
0:3:32.975 --> 0:3:39.535
Basement
So following up, you know, with what you sent me, kind of the immediate.
0:3:42.415 --> 0:3:43.135
Basement
That's man.
0:3:43.775 --> 0:3:43.975
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:3:43.775 --> 0:3:48.95
Basement
The the admin access that's being done.
0:3:48.585 --> 0:3:48.785
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:3:50.265 --> 0:3:58.465
Basement
Complete audit of current digital presence and sites I sent you all the different sites.
0:3:54.655 --> 0:3:54.855
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:4:2.735 --> 0:4:6.135
Basement
I believe both sites and social.
0:4:8.105 --> 0:4:15.705
Basement
Review the existing text act. You'll, I guess have to do that with Brian and and Stephen.
0:4:13.865 --> 0:4:14.265
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
0:4:18.105 --> 0:4:19.705
Basement
The patient's journey.
0:4:20.305 --> 0:4:28.265
Basement
What what I sent to you was kind of the nomenclature. Everything from lead prospect, opportunity to.
0:4:30.545 --> 0:4:31.865
Basement
Met member.
0:4:32.655 --> 0:4:45.55
Basement
And then former and there's there's some statuses of almost all of those, and I think it's important as we're building.
0:4:34.515 --> 0:4:34.715
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:4:46.865 --> 0:4:54.185
Basement
Audiences that we that that that we know who we're talking to, right, so.
0:4:48.475 --> 0:4:48.555
Luis Escobar
Mm.
0:4:54.365 --> 0:4:54.565
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:4:55.945 --> 0:5:2.585
Basement
For for the most part, I think we've we've kept that that nomenclature pretty clean.
0:5:2.895 --> 0:5:4.415
Basement
Right, Steven?
0:5:5.865 --> 0:5:18.985
Basement
Yeah, it's it's a little bit messy with like aesthetic appointments, because our definition of like a prospect is that they've been had a patient record created in open medical and that they've been scheduled for an appointment.
0:5:18.985 --> 0:5:20.985
Basement
So technically, all of our aesthetic.
0:5:22.615 --> 0:5:25.255
Basement
Purchasers are just as product.
0:5:25.255 --> 0:5:28.15
Basement
There is no lead, I guess, right?
0:5:28.15 --> 0:5:36.495
Basement
Is that what? There's no, there's no lead to member cycle for aesthetic purchasers to aesthetic members like there's no.
0:5:37.175 --> 0:5:40.55
Basement
I mean, we have like 5 aesthetic members, so that bags.
0:5:42.225 --> 0:5:45.145
Basement
02 A member. OK, so we don't.
0:5:45.265 --> 0:5:45.465
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:5:45.465 --> 0:5:51.985
Basement
Yeah. So, so we sell recurring monthly memberships much like.
0:5:53.785 --> 0:5:54.345
Basement
Life force.
0:5:54.655 --> 0:6:1.95
Basement
Etc etc. On the hell side, we also sell it on the Assembly side as well.
0:6:1.335 --> 0:6:3.855
Basement
However, we haven't really pushed that much.
0:6:5.345 --> 0:6:10.385
Basement
And so far we have not been successful doing that.
0:6:12.545 --> 0:6:13.65
Basement
The.
0:6:14.495 --> 0:6:27.135
Basement
Benefit of being a health client is that is that you're also automatically enrolled and you get the discounts on the aesthetic side too.
0:6:27.575 --> 0:6:32.175
Basement
Now, of course that only works if you're in per person.
0:6:33.665 --> 0:6:35.225
Basement
Brick and mortar, you know you.
0:6:35.225 --> 0:6:39.665
Basement
You live by by one of the physical offices.
0:6:35.625 --> 0:6:35.825
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:6:39.705 --> 0:6:44.425
Basement
If you're doing telehealth, the whole lead journey.
0:6:44.775 --> 0:6:47.215
Basement
Might be different too.
0:6:47.215 --> 0:6:48.135
Basement
Yeah, it is.
0:6:48.135 --> 0:6:59.975
Basement
It's a little bit different 'cause we don't technically have opportunities. I think for telehealth they just go straight from like, well, we don't even have prospects really just go straight from lead to member for the most part for telehealth.
0:7:0.855 --> 0:7:2.135
Luis Escobar
From lead to member I see.
0:7:3.125 --> 0:7:6.965
Basement
Yeah, because they, they don't even get a call with. Like they don't have.
0:7:6.965 --> 0:7:7.925
Basement
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
0:7:7.925 --> 0:7:8.805
Basement
They they don't.
0:7:9.125 --> 0:7:12.325
Basement
They they just agree to buy online.
0:7:13.745 --> 0:7:19.705
Basement
Which is another reason why likely, oh Brian's here now. OK, Brian.
0:7:25.855 --> 0:7:26.375
Basement
So.
0:7:29.545 --> 0:7:37.745
Basement
On the telehealth side that that might be a reason why maybe we could do a much better job honestly of explaining.
0:7:39.705 --> 0:7:43.545
Basement
What telehealth is we've for a long time.
0:7:43.545 --> 0:7:46.345
Basement
I think we realized a lot of our telehealth ads.
0:7:48.145 --> 0:7:48.865
Basement
Were were.
0:7:51.225 --> 0:7:53.305
Basement
Landing only to the home page.
0:7:53.935 --> 0:8:0.375
Basement
And not directly to the telehealth page which which actually shows why you would join.
0:8:2.705 --> 0:8:13.225
Basement
So it's it's simple but important things like that that might make it difference. And I think Brian can chime in too.
0:8:15.705 --> 0:8:17.865
Basement
You know, a lot of our ads.
0:8:19.545 --> 0:8:22.665
Basement
Need to be dropped to web pages.
0:8:23.215 --> 0:8:24.455
Basement
Better just better.
0:8:25.945 --> 0:8:26.25
Basement
So.
0:8:26.205 --> 0:8:27.85
Luis Escobar
Yeah, absolutely.
0:8:27.85 --> 0:8:30.85
Luis Escobar
We want to create, you know, a series of lead magnets, right?
0:8:31.595 --> 0:8:34.275
Luis Escobar
And and put them out to the test.
0:8:34.275 --> 0:8:41.755
Luis Escobar
Do some swit testing and and really refine the the targeting right for for each of these different need magnets.
0:8:42.935 --> 0:8:57.55
Basement
Yeah, so, so, so, yo, you have two things going on. I think in your immediate five points, you know one you have, how do we grow and increase the leads and market to them better.
0:8:51.35 --> 0:8:51.235
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:8:57.175 --> 0:9:3.415
Basement
Secondly, secondly, you have, hey, we have existing clients and they're on its journey.
0:8:57.325 --> 0:8:57.525
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:9:3.415 --> 0:9:6.615
Basement
How do we make the communication with them better, right?
0:9:4.45 --> 0:9:4.125
Luis Escobar
Mm.
0:9:6.495 --> 0:9:6.695
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:9:6.775 --> 0:9:8.575
Basement
So. So I kind of think.
0:9:9.345 --> 0:9:13.105
Basement
Because because when I see you say assess your marketing automation.
0:9:14.455 --> 0:9:26.175
Basement
And lead generation. Maybe you're talking about new only new new business. But on your 4th bullet point, you're talking about the current patient journey.
0:9:23.35 --> 0:9:23.235
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:9:27.665 --> 0:9:32.65
Basement
And identifying key pain points there. I think that's hugely important as well.
0:9:33.65 --> 0:9:33.265
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:9:33.785 --> 0:9:36.385
Basement
You know that that'll help plug the bucket.
0:9:36.945 --> 0:9:39.145
Basement
You know, plug the hole in the bucket.
0:9:40.785 --> 0:9:41.665
Basement
If you will so.
0:9:41.425 --> 0:9:42.745
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I agree.
0:9:44.275 --> 0:9:51.715
Luis Escobar
So yeah, we we wanna what I you know wanna definitely focus on is making sure that we have the pipeline properly structured.
0:9:44.575 --> 0:9:45.95
Basement
So.
0:9:52.595 --> 0:9:53.515
Luis Escobar
Do you guys see my screen?
0:9:54.805 --> 0:9:55.125
Basement
Yeah.
0:9:55.515 --> 0:10:3.275
Luis Escobar
I'm in your HubSpot deal pipeline right now. So yeah, I just wanna make sure you know that this is as refined as it should be.
0:10:3.465 --> 0:10:5.825
Luis Escobar
Or maybe we need to add some steps in between?
0:10:7.275 --> 0:10:10.555
Luis Escobar
Another thing is also that speed to leave tracking right.
0:10:10.555 --> 0:10:23.195
Luis Escobar
So this is essentially just like the amount of time it takes between, you know, a lead coming into the you know, ecosystem and then the amount of time that it takes for us to engage with them. They're in the form of a call, e-mail a meeting or or.
0:10:23.235 --> 0:10:33.755
Luis Escobar
Getting them to to access, you know, the lead magnet that they, you know signed it signed up for and really aligning what you know what the ad says with what they're getting, right.
0:10:34.625 --> 0:10:39.865
Luis Escobar
If we can, you know, really make sure that that's really dialed in for both.
0:10:39.905 --> 0:10:44.985
Luis Escobar
You know the internal existing clients and for fresh brand new leads.
0:10:54.955 --> 0:11:0.115
Luis Escobar
In regards to your system audit, I was just taking a look at you know what integrations you have here.
0:11:1.635 --> 0:11:5.75
Luis Escobar
Seems like you have a few installed, but not all activated.
0:11:9.15 --> 0:11:11.815
Luis Escobar
With data connector I see you got air call.
0:11:13.225 --> 0:11:16.745
Luis Escobar
Zoom up top payments. Great.
0:11:17.515 --> 0:11:18.75
Basement
Yeah, trend.
0:11:17.905 --> 0:11:18.545
Luis Escobar
Yeah, why not.
0:11:18.75 --> 0:11:22.115
Basement
Just actually started a trial for air call on Friday, I think.
0:11:22.115 --> 0:11:27.995
Basement
Yeah, we have like four more days left of the free trial or whatever, but I know that was that was big for you.
0:11:27.995 --> 0:11:30.875
Basement
So I'm sure we can make some kind of commitment there.
0:11:31.75 --> 0:11:33.555
Basement
I'm just not sure how to utilize it currently.
0:11:35.305 --> 0:11:36.465
Luis Escobar
The best approach is.
0:11:36.585 --> 0:11:39.585
Luis Escobar
I'll log in and do the initial configuration right.
0:11:39.585 --> 0:11:40.825
Luis Escobar
We can notice.
0:11:42.25 --> 0:11:46.425
Luis Escobar
Create just one user, one phone number and then you know all these things should be rolled out.
0:11:47.955 --> 0:11:48.875
Luis Escobar
In in phases, right?
0:11:48.875 --> 0:11:56.75
Luis Escobar
Let's let's get the proof of concept working with one or two of the sales reps right and make sure everything is, you know, the way it should be.
0:11:56.75 --> 0:11:57.755
Luis Escobar
And then we roll it out to the entire team.
0:12:1.405 --> 0:12:6.45
Basement
Sharing access with you to or I'll add you to the air call now.
0:12:7.385 --> 0:12:8.385
Luis Escobar
Great. Great.
0:12:11.755 --> 0:12:12.555
Luis Escobar
There's this.
0:12:12.555 --> 0:12:17.435
Luis Escobar
Also this other company I really want you guys to work with. They're called project blue.
0:12:17.955 --> 0:12:21.955
Luis Escobar
What they're doing is iMessage from inside of HubSpot.
0:12:24.305 --> 0:12:30.305
Luis Escobar
So it'll send out, you know, the iMessage blue blue texts.
0:12:30.665 --> 0:12:31.465
Luis Escobar
I can get that.
0:12:31.505 --> 0:12:36.945
Luis Escobar
You know, I can schedule a meeting for us, maybe for tomorrow and get the ball rolling this week.
0:12:37.185 --> 0:12:46.185
Luis Escobar
That'll take about a week and a half to fully activate, but I I've seen this make a pretty big impact just in the response, right?
0:12:46.465 --> 0:12:49.585
Luis Escobar
A lot of these text messages are getting getting sent to spam.
0:12:49.585 --> 0:12:53.665
Luis Escobar
A lot of the carriers iPhone just released a new update that's gonna make it even harder.
0:12:55.885 --> 0:12:58.485
Luis Escobar
Companies that are doing mass marketing mass texting.
0:12:59.745 --> 0:13:4.145
Luis Escobar
So yeah, I messages definitely something that we can implement this week.
0:13:7.385 --> 0:13:9.105
Basement
Cool. What was that?
0:13:9.105 --> 0:13:10.505
Basement
What was that company called?
0:13:11.475 --> 0:13:12.355
Luis Escobar
Project blue.
0:13:12.635 --> 0:13:13.75
Basement
Project blue.
0:13:14.285 --> 0:13:14.605
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:13:22.335 --> 0:13:22.455
Luis Escobar
Umm.
0:13:22.525 --> 0:13:25.925
Basement
I'm working on my Spanish. Oh.
0:13:24.655 --> 0:13:25.775
Luis Escobar
OK and.
0:13:27.225 --> 0:13:27.265
Luis Escobar
I.
0:13:28.915 --> 0:13:31.475
Basement
Yeah, good job, it said.
0:13:31.475 --> 0:13:38.635
Basement
User creation like getting you into air call is unavailable while your company is inactive. Is there.
0:13:40.195 --> 0:13:40.235
Basement
A.
0:13:40.235 --> 0:13:43.355
Basement
Do you activate it via HubSpot or would I do that on the platform here?
0:13:44.615 --> 0:13:45.615
Luis Escobar
On the platform.
0:13:47.35 --> 0:13:48.315
Luis Escobar
There should be like an onboarding process.
0:13:50.75 --> 0:13:52.75
Basement
Did your truck trial end or anything?
0:13:52.75 --> 0:13:56.555
Basement
No, it was seven days. But it says, yeah, it's wanting me to upgrade now.
0:13:58.645 --> 0:14:0.765
Basement
Of course, but of.
0:14:3.985 --> 0:14:4.665
Basement
It's here.
0:14:4.665 --> 0:14:10.865
Basement
That or give him your. Your. Yeah, I might just do that 'cause. I don't know exactly what plan we should do.
0:14:11.225 --> 0:14:12.345
Basement
We should, I mean.
0:14:12.145 --> 0:14:14.185
Luis Escobar
That don't don't add another user.
0:14:14.185 --> 0:14:22.505
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that's that's a tricky part with with Ercal, who basically one of the users will serve as like the global admin and we can all use it to log in.
0:14:16.605 --> 0:14:17.5
Basement
Pract.
0:14:23.815 --> 0:14:26.295
Basement
And I'm just going to send you my credentials for that.
0:14:29.115 --> 0:14:30.115
Luis Escobar
Perfect. Perfect.
0:14:32.695 --> 0:14:37.455
Luis Escobar
And and Ted, your question earlier about you know getting Google Workspace?
0:14:38.955 --> 0:14:52.955
Luis Escobar
I do think it's it's something we should do. At least just get one administrator account and main reason is for the Google Gemini AI, right? We want that to be a A based on the Google Company account, right?
0:14:53.115 --> 0:15:0.635
Luis Escobar
And eventually, everyone's gonna have their own AI agents and and they're all gonna be interconnected through the form of Gmail, Google Drive.
0:15:1.295 --> 0:15:4.495
Luis Escobar
HubSpot all these systems talking to each other, right?
0:15:4.935 --> 0:15:8.175
Luis Escobar
But you know it's it's possible also with Microsoft.
0:15:8.175 --> 0:15:9.775
Luis Escobar
I'm not gonna, you know, say it's not.
0:15:10.335 --> 0:15:17.215
Luis Escobar
It's just a much more streamlined, in my opinion than we're we'll get more value out of it in the long run.
0:15:19.65 --> 0:15:23.305
Basement
Do you want to do that or who can do that? Sure. Is it?
0:15:25.395 --> 0:15:25.955
Basement
Yeah, that works.
0:15:25.955 --> 0:15:32.515
Basement
Or we can have John set that up since he's been the one like kinda manages outlook and then he just can assign me as a admin.
0:15:34.915 --> 0:15:37.715
Basement
And what what's the process?
0:15:35.655 --> 0:15:36.255
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we.
0:15:37.715 --> 0:15:39.395
Basement
You just register.
0:15:41.395 --> 0:15:47.755
Basement
The e-mail. I don't know what the process. I never worked in a googly Google.
0:15:48.985 --> 0:15:49.985
Basement
Workspace so.
0:15:50.385 --> 0:15:54.825
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I I can set it up for us if you want, but it's, yes, super straightforward.
0:15:54.825 --> 0:15:56.265
Luis Escobar
Takes like 5 minutes and then.
0:15:55.315 --> 0:15:56.595
Basement
OK, OK.
0:15:57.795 --> 0:16:2.915
Luis Escobar
We can, you know, make use the enu domain or use a new domain as like a as a.
0:16:4.625 --> 0:16:6.465
Luis Escobar
Placeholder for now, right?
0:16:6.665 --> 0:16:11.905
Luis Escobar
We we don't have to, you know, point the e-mail domain away from Microsoft right now.
0:16:11.905 --> 0:16:12.265
Luis Escobar
I know that.
0:16:12.265 --> 0:16:15.985
Luis Escobar
Can that can be a process or has other factors involved?
0:16:19.525 --> 0:16:25.45
Luis Escobar
Yeah. And what I've done in the past is like we can get enewdev.com and then run that through.
0:16:27.315 --> 0:16:27.915
Luis Escobar
Google.
0:16:28.985 --> 0:16:31.185
Luis Escobar
We can always add or replace domains.
0:16:29.65 --> 0:16:29.465
Basement
OK.
0:16:37.545 --> 0:16:40.65
Basement
I just sent you the login for air call.
0:16:40.265 --> 0:16:43.185
Basement
We we we have a. The other thing is too.
0:16:43.185 --> 0:16:50.625
Basement
We didn't provide you with we we we have a lot of different domains that we own.
0:16:52.355 --> 0:16:58.515
Basement
A lot of variations of the same brand name, so maybe you could use one of those, I don't know.
0:16:56.395 --> 0:16:56.595
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:17:0.5 --> 0:17:5.805
Luis Escobar
Yeah, definitely. The the more aligned that the domain is with the advertisement, you know the the better.
0:17:6.565 --> 0:17:7.165
Luis Escobar
All right.
0:17:7.165 --> 0:17:18.525
Luis Escobar
If if we're, you know, pushing in a a a female oriented advertisement, if there's, you know if the domain the branding, the colors the more aligned all that is the better.
0:17:20.285 --> 0:17:24.5
Luis Escobar
Yeah. So we'll definitely make use of those multiple domains you have.
0:17:25.75 --> 0:17:26.835
Basement
Brian, didn't we?
0:17:29.185 --> 0:17:30.865
Basement
Register while you were here.
0:17:31.625 --> 0:17:33.505
Basement
The gender specific.
0:17:35.345 --> 0:17:36.25
Brian Hyatt
Yes, we did.
0:17:37.505 --> 0:17:38.185
Basement
So what?
0:17:38.185 --> 0:17:43.385
Basement
What? What was that new man.com and Newman dot.
0:17:45.555 --> 0:17:45.875
Basement
What was it again?
0:17:48.465 --> 0:17:53.145
Brian Hyatt
Let me I can jump in and take a look at it real quick.
0:17:53.305 --> 0:17:54.425
Brian Hyatt
Tell you what they were.
0:17:59.795 --> 0:18:0.35
Luis Escobar
People.
0:18:2.185 --> 0:18:2.585
Luis Escobar
Great.
0:18:6.965 --> 0:18:13.845
Luis Escobar
The other thing I wanted to discuss is also the data that you have sitting in in dental portal.
0:18:15.435 --> 0:18:18.995
Basement
Yeah. Open dental I was.
0:18:17.685 --> 0:18:18.405
Luis Escobar
Open dental.
0:18:19.75 --> 0:18:28.915
Basement
I'm gonna have to, I think, reach out to see what we what we need to do to get you set up with your own credentials there.
0:18:26.505 --> 0:18:26.585
Luis Escobar
Mm.
0:18:28.915 --> 0:18:34.715
Basement
But yeah, that's I think I need to go with sciotech just to have them set you up there.
0:18:34.465 --> 0:18:34.985
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:18:35.545 --> 0:18:41.185
Luis Escobar
Great. Yeah. I just want to again do an audit of that, get an understanding.
0:18:41.185 --> 0:18:44.985
Luis Escobar
You know what's the best approach for us to migrate data from?
0:18:46.595 --> 0:18:48.35
Luis Escobar
That platform over to HubSpot.
0:18:49.835 --> 0:18:55.395
Luis Escobar
Before we even begin the migration, we wanna make sure we have all of our custom fields in there, for example.
0:18:57.155 --> 0:18:58.555
Luis Escobar
Let me see what else.
0:19:3.655 --> 0:19:8.735
Luis Escobar
Properties. Have you guys made any customizations in HubSpot in terms of like adding?
0:19:10.35 --> 0:19:11.115
Basement
We have.
0:19:11.555 --> 0:19:14.915
Basement
They're like the appointment reason right there, that's one.
0:19:15.695 --> 0:19:15.895
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:19:17.305 --> 0:19:20.545
Basement
We we have that. Let's see.
0:19:21.875 --> 0:19:24.635
Basement
Actually, I think we stopped using that.
0:19:24.635 --> 0:19:29.315
Basement
We simplified how we were using that, but like Pella health state is one contact detail.
0:19:29.315 --> 0:19:32.795
Basement
I know we added in specifically for the the telehealth.
0:19:30.755 --> 0:19:30.955
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:19:34.625 --> 0:19:41.425
Basement
Process because it the telehealth state didn't exactly line up always with their their residential, their state of residence.
0:19:34.915 --> 0:19:35.155
Luis Escobar
Call it.
0:19:41.425 --> 0:19:43.505
Basement
So that was one I know.
0:19:42.915 --> 0:19:43.115
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:19:44.955 --> 0:19:47.435
Basement
Appointment scheduled right there. Appointment scheduled question Mark.
0:19:47.435 --> 0:19:53.515
Basement
That was, I think that has to do with the telehealth workflow, but not sure if it's being activated by any other.
0:19:55.955 --> 0:19:57.715
Basement
Any other payments or anything like that?
0:19:59.435 --> 0:20:4.795
Basement
There's a lot of them in there that are from the OM aggregation table, but that was like a one time migration I think.
0:20:5.805 --> 0:20:6.205
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
0:20:6.435 --> 0:20:6.555
Luis Escobar
Mm H.
0:20:7.835 --> 0:20:10.155
Basement
A lot of survey questions are in there.
0:20:10.155 --> 0:20:12.715
Basement
Those were from a typeform, I think survey.
0:20:13.695 --> 0:20:14.375
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:20:14.405 --> 0:20:20.85
Basement
OK, that was just a one time migration. I think we had pretty much stopped using it, but we wanted to keep the data.
0:20:21.725 --> 0:20:28.365
Basement
There's a lot of custom fields in there I guess, but a lot of them are not. Almost almost none of them are being updated.
0:20:24.365 --> 0:20:25.645
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.
0:20:30.795 --> 0:20:31.315
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:20:30.805 --> 0:20:31.325
Basement
Sure. Yeah.
0:20:31.395 --> 0:20:33.635
Luis Escobar
So yeah, we're gonna also, like, clean that up, right?
0:20:33.635 --> 0:20:46.475
Luis Escobar
Anything that's just not being used or or excess just to have it as much as a of a clean database as we can and definitely get all the different fields and field types that that are on the open dental.
0:20:48.85 --> 0:20:57.205
Luis Escobar
If, if, if it's a drop down field on on the dental software then we need to make sure the drop down field also in HubSpot makes sense.
0:20:57.845 --> 0:20:57.925
Basement
Mm.
0:21:2.725 --> 0:21:10.565
Luis Escobar
Also in in regards to like how we're gonna do the migration, have you had a chance to look at Nan?
0:21:12.645 --> 0:21:13.445
Basement
A little bit.
0:21:13.965 --> 0:21:19.165
Luis Escobar
Yeah. So yeah, I think we should also create like a primary admin account, right?
0:21:19.165 --> 0:21:25.205
Luis Escobar
And basically that'll be the core of where a lot of automations are taking place, right?
0:21:25.205 --> 0:21:30.5
Luis Escobar
Sending communications to our different administrators, managers. Slack.
0:21:31.765 --> 0:21:41.965
Luis Escobar
Do you guys have like scheduled reports going out from your HubSpot to to the executive team or the management team on on a routine basis?
0:21:43.195 --> 0:21:44.835
Basement
Not not much.
0:21:44.835 --> 0:21:48.595
Basement
If anything, they're just like one off being created.
0:21:51.35 --> 0:21:54.35
Luis Escobar
Gotcha. So yeah, we'll implement those two.
0:21:51.125 --> 0:21:51.205
Basement
No.
0:21:54.395 --> 0:21:56.755
Luis Escobar
It'll be done through HubSpot, right?
0:21:56.755 --> 0:21:58.635
Luis Escobar
I see you have any add journey.
0:22:1.695 --> 0:22:4.855
Luis Escobar
So I wanted to find these different reports and get some key ones flowing.
0:22:6.365 --> 0:22:10.125
Luis Escobar
This week as well, we can have those reports getting signed via e-mail.
0:22:10.125 --> 0:22:11.725
Luis Escobar
We'll send them to teams as well.
0:22:14.525 --> 0:22:19.85
Luis Escobar
I I do think that, you know, it would be wise for us to make the switch to slack, right?
0:22:20.725 --> 0:22:23.845
Luis Escobar
There's just a it's a superior communication platform, right?
0:22:25.525 --> 0:22:27.405
Luis Escobar
It's also not something that we need to do immediately.
0:22:32.195 --> 0:22:35.355
Luis Escobar
I want to focus on, you know, making big changes on the things that matter right now.
0:22:36.885 --> 0:22:38.165
Luis Escobar
What's going to really move the needle?
0:22:39.355 --> 0:22:47.955
Luis Escobar
I want to get an idea of like you know how we can improve the overall brand message. You know, what is the overarching?
0:22:49.955 --> 0:22:53.515
Luis Escobar
Mission statement or or the essence of the brand right?
0:22:54.75 --> 0:22:56.395
Luis Escobar
I know you guys have a new pretty established.
0:22:58.125 --> 0:22:59.85
Luis Escobar
I do like the colors.
0:22:59.85 --> 0:22:59.765
Luis Escobar
I do like yellow.
0:23:1.405 --> 0:23:1.925
Luis Escobar
You know you can.
0:23:2.5 --> 0:23:2.965
Luis Escobar
You can keep growing on that.
0:23:2.165 --> 0:23:3.805
Basement
It's supposed to be gold, but OK.
0:23:4.605 --> 0:23:4.925
Luis Escobar
Gold yellow.
0:23:6.605 --> 0:23:10.245
Luis Escobar
But yeah, we'll we'll keep evolving on that, I think.
0:23:11.965 --> 0:23:14.45
Luis Escobar
But maybe just modernize it a bit, right?
0:23:14.645 --> 0:23:16.365
Luis Escobar
Be more concise with our messaging.
0:23:18.875 --> 0:23:20.235
Luis Escobar
Revamping the like.
0:23:19.375 --> 0:23:19.695
Basement
Yeah.
0:23:21.645 --> 0:23:21.925
Luis Escobar
Go ahead.
0:23:22.565 --> 0:23:29.725
Basement
No, there there was a brand standard in the graphic design or the drop Dropbox.
0:23:29.965 --> 0:23:38.125
Basement
There was an early we had hired a a fairly large agency to build us like.
0:23:39.605 --> 0:23:39.645
Basement
A.
0:23:39.645 --> 0:23:40.165
Basement
A brand.
0:23:44.85 --> 0:23:46.5
Basement
Pyramid, if you will.
0:23:47.725 --> 0:23:49.245
Basement
And and you're right.
0:23:49.875 --> 0:23:52.35
Basement
Oh it. It needs to be updated.
0:23:53.565 --> 0:24:7.885
Basement
At that time it was heavily secured or heavily digested that that we focus on aesthetics and specifically women aged 35 to 45.
0:24:10.85 --> 0:24:16.125
Basement
But but but. But that really flies in the face of what our key demo was.
0:24:17.155 --> 0:24:17.555
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
0:24:17.845 --> 0:24:18.405
Basement
And I think.
0:24:18.715 --> 0:24:23.115
Basement
Still is. I think that there's a, you know, a large.
0:24:25.85 --> 0:24:31.445
Basement
Population of adults 35 to 55 that are like, whoa, what the ****** happening?
0:24:31.445 --> 0:24:49.645
Basement
You know I need somebody along the ride here to not lose muscle to to, to lose weight, to feel better, to not be depressed, you know, and they want to know all their key key body markers.
0:24:49.915 --> 0:25:4.875
Basement
And they're willing to pay mostly for that access. You know that that, that, that, that, you know, having your own physician assigned to you your own care team, if you will.
0:25:4.875 --> 0:25:15.435
Basement
And I think that that's something that we don't highlight enough is having access no matter where you're at, if you're on vacation wherever we'll call in scripts.
0:25:15.435 --> 0:25:18.795
Basement
If you're sick, we'll, you know, we'll do those things.
0:25:19.35 --> 0:25:27.435
Basement
That no other telehealth company, you know, no other telehealth company that boast optimal health, you know, optimal hormones.
0:25:26.385 --> 0:25:26.585
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:25:29.165 --> 0:25:34.445
Basement
Peptides, all that no other company is doing primary care as well.
0:25:34.445 --> 0:25:39.725
Basement
So so really we in a sense we we we almost.
0:25:41.645 --> 0:25:42.965
Basement
Are access and we're kind of.
0:25:45.5 --> 0:25:48.685
Basement
Insurance. I mean, you know, while everybody still needs insurance.
0:25:49.195 --> 0:26:0.595
Basement
For large large type operations or emergency care, you know, I mean a lot of what we do or a lot of the Healthcare is covered.
0:26:2.205 --> 0:26:18.445
Basement
Through your monthly membership with us. So, so, so. So we don't do a good job of cleanly, plainly stating that, you know, I mean that that really it's a designer level.
0:26:14.545 --> 0:26:14.665
Luis Escobar
Why?
0:26:16.155 --> 0:26:16.675
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:26:18.915 --> 0:26:24.235
Basement
Experience. You know, there's no waiting that you know you're immediately seeing.
0:26:24.235 --> 0:26:25.675
Basement
Your time is valued.
0:26:25.955 --> 0:26:28.35
Basement
You can get everything done at once.
0:26:29.525 --> 0:26:37.885
Basement
We can order any any labs, any scans, any anything that you need can be done, whether it's it's in.
0:26:29.815 --> 0:26:30.15
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:26:39.725 --> 0:26:42.725
Basement
Our our arson or telehealth, so.
0:26:44.405 --> 0:26:49.325
Luis Escobar
Do you guys have like a like a an explainer video?
0:26:45.885 --> 0:26:46.5
Basement
Yes.
0:26:49.325 --> 0:26:53.565
Luis Escobar
Like a solid 92nd video that that really clearly explains everything.
0:26:53.725 --> 0:26:56.765
Basement
No, but, but that's exactly what we need.
0:26:56.885 --> 0:27:11.605
Basement
Really we need that not only for for web website, but I think we we almost need a preflight video when somebody comes in to do their labs or just before the provider meets with them.
0:27:2.85 --> 0:27:2.285
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:27:12.645 --> 0:27:12.845
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:27:13.725 --> 0:27:22.965
Basement
The the The the MA would just press play and it be a 92nd hype video on all the things.
0:27:23.235 --> 0:27:43.735
Basement
That we do because I think because I think once that meeting starts there becomes very singular focus on what that pain is or what what their and that that's important that that, that that we focus on the reason why they're there. But we also don't want them to.
0:27:41.605 --> 0:27:41.805
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:27:43.725 --> 0:27:53.235
Basement
Forget the reasons why they should stay and and I think that if we had that video and we and we use variations of that video over time.
0:27:53.315 --> 0:27:53.715
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
0:27:53.355 --> 0:27:56.595
Basement
Time it would help them remember.
0:27:56.595 --> 0:28:4.715
Basement
Hey, don't forget there's more than you know, the reason why you came to us shouldn't be the reason why you stay.
0:28:4.755 --> 0:28:9.395
Basement
Because the reason why you came to us, we should already have taken care of, right?
0:28:9.385 --> 0:28:9.585
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:28:9.435 --> 0:28:18.955
Basement
The the reason why you stay is because you want to get healthier and better and you want to get healthier as you age, which which is kind of a weird idea, right?
0:28:18.955 --> 0:28:20.835
Basement
But that that should be our brand.
0:28:20.835 --> 0:28:22.395
Basement
I mean, our brand is.
0:28:23.125 --> 0:28:24.405
Basement
We are here for you every step of the way.
0:28:25.365 --> 0:28:26.445
Basement
Kind of thing so.
0:28:25.435 --> 0:28:26.475
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I really do.
0:28:26.475 --> 0:28:36.115
Luis Escobar
You wanna speak to like the real, like, deep, you know, down desires and and we all have the same ones, which is live a long, healthy life essentially, right.
0:28:36.115 --> 0:28:39.555
Luis Escobar
That's if if we can, you know, really drive that message.
0:28:36.265 --> 0:28:36.625
Basement
Yeah.
0:28:39.555 --> 0:28:43.315
Luis Escobar
So, like here's one example I wanna share with you guys so.
0:28:45.165 --> 0:28:49.45
Luis Escobar
I love that you guys are doing holiday promotions, holiday marketing, right?
0:28:49.45 --> 0:28:53.685
Luis Escobar
Every, every holiday is a great, you know, revenue boosting opportunity.
0:28:53.955 --> 0:28:54.475
Luis Escobar
Right.
0:28:56.525 --> 0:28:58.205
Luis Escobar
Seems like you guys are running with this.
0:28:58.205 --> 0:29:1.925
Luis Escobar
Celebrate dad with our Father's Day special, 50% off health assessment.
0:29:2.725 --> 0:29:6.205
Luis Escobar
That's it's all right, but it's not what we need, right?
0:29:6.205 --> 0:29:7.365
Luis Escobar
Look, look at this.
0:29:9.125 --> 0:29:9.725
Luis Escobar
What is that?
0:29:11.5 --> 0:29:12.45
Luis Escobar
You guys see my screen.
0:29:12.795 --> 0:29:15.195
Basement
Yeah. Yeah, I was gonna.
0:29:14.695 --> 0:29:15.175
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:29:15.195 --> 0:29:16.475
Basement
I was literally gonna show you that today.
0:29:16.475 --> 0:29:18.915
Basement
I was like it's it's the.
0:29:16.805 --> 0:29:17.205
Luis Escobar
I took a.
0:29:20.965 --> 0:29:24.645
Basement
Emotion. There is better. It's just.
0:29:23.795 --> 0:29:25.475
Luis Escobar
You see the difference you see?
0:29:25.475 --> 0:29:29.595
Luis Escobar
Yeah, like that. Like speaks your soul like, you know, it's an emotional trigger.
0:29:27.5 --> 0:29:27.85
Basement
Yeah.
0:29:28.355 --> 0:29:28.795
Basement
Yeah.
0:29:31.125 --> 0:29:34.645
Luis Escobar
So that's really what you know, we want to strive for, right.
0:29:31.605 --> 0:29:33.645
Basement
Dad deserves better, I mean.
0:29:35.365 --> 0:29:36.605
Luis Escobar
You know 25% off.
0:29:36.605 --> 0:29:38.965
Luis Escobar
It's just just another marketing, you know.
0:29:38.965 --> 0:29:41.285
Luis Escobar
People get turned off by that, if any, like another.
0:29:43.225 --> 0:29:48.225
Basement
Make sure your computer is plugged in. I saw 6%.
0:29:49.75 --> 0:29:50.915
Luis Escobar
That wasn't a screenshot of this.
0:29:50.905 --> 0:29:52.865
Basement
Oh yeah. OK.
0:29:52.365 --> 0:29:53.5
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, that's why.
0:29:52.865 --> 0:29:55.25
Basement
All right, all right, all right, all right.
0:29:55.165 --> 0:29:55.685
Luis Escobar
I saw it.
0:29:55.685 --> 0:29:58.605
Luis Escobar
And yeah, I wanted to make sure I captured it.
0:29:59.785 --> 0:30:4.785
Basement
Yeah, but I we we we sort of saw it did actually, so yeah.
0:30:4.675 --> 0:30:4.875
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:30:6.475 --> 0:30:7.555
Luis Escobar
Yeah, overall, right.
0:30:7.625 --> 0:30:13.625
Luis Escobar
So we wanna have, you know, all these different tag we first got really define the tagline and these different headlines, right.
0:30:11.115 --> 0:30:11.875
Basement
The motion.
0:30:13.985 --> 0:30:14.825
Luis Escobar
That are gonna.
0:30:15.785 --> 0:30:16.985
Luis Escobar
Of our marketing, right?
0:30:17.105 --> 0:30:19.385
Luis Escobar
We wanna get that video produced.
0:30:20.145 --> 0:30:26.585
Luis Escobar
Do you guys have like an in House video editor or someone to provide that resource?
0:30:28.135 --> 0:30:30.295
Basement
We have yes or no.
0:30:30.295 --> 0:30:36.735
Basement
I mean, yeah, I would say yes and no. I think that she does pretty basic editing.
0:30:38.15 --> 0:30:38.495
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:30:38.155 --> 0:30:43.75
Basement
I think that she's graphic design before she's a video editor, so yeah.
0:30:41.915 --> 0:30:42.475
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:30:42.835 --> 0:30:43.835
Luis Escobar
So yeah, we want.
0:30:43.955 --> 0:30:45.515
Luis Escobar
We want Hollywood, right?
0:30:45.555 --> 0:30:51.555
Luis Escobar
We want to make this feel cinematic and and really high quality, right?
0:30:51.555 --> 0:30:53.675
Luis Escobar
So I'll connect those with some resources.
0:30:53.675 --> 0:30:56.715
Luis Escobar
I know we can, you know, work with them.
0:30:56.715 --> 0:30:59.875
Luis Escobar
They're really high professional guys I've worked with in the past.
0:30:59.875 --> 0:31:5.955
Luis Escobar
They're they're really good at creating, you know, really engaging viral videos for social media.
0:31:6.755 --> 0:31:7.835
Luis Escobar
They're also very good at these.
0:31:7.835 --> 0:31:10.515
Luis Escobar
More long form like kind of documentary style videos.
0:31:11.305 --> 0:31:12.25
Luis Escobar
Right date.
0:31:14.35 --> 0:31:25.35
Luis Escobar
The offer, actually a documentary product right where they'll actually like, you know, come out with a whole camera crew and and film like a Netflix style documentary, right?
0:31:25.35 --> 0:31:26.435
Luis Escobar
Like 90 minutes long.
0:31:27.995 --> 0:31:33.435
Luis Escobar
And and I mean it, you can get not just, you know, the footage you're gonna get from that 90 minutes.
0:31:33.435 --> 0:31:33.955
Luis Escobar
You can.
0:31:34.35 --> 0:31:35.275
Luis Escobar
You can repurpose that, right?
0:31:35.275 --> 0:31:41.995
Luis Escobar
We can create different clips for for marketing on Instagram and and all these different channels.
0:31:42.785 --> 0:31:46.785
Luis Escobar
Right, so content creation is also something I wanna go over, right?
0:31:46.785 --> 0:31:58.385
Luis Escobar
How can we not just create create content one time but on a ongoing basis have like a content creation machine? You know one one of the like the most trending styles right now is that you see these guys in podcast, right?
0:31:58.905 --> 0:32:6.985
Luis Escobar
They'll do like a 90 minute podcast, but you know, out of those 90 minutes they'll get, you know, 20-30 clips, right? So.
0:32:7.675 --> 0:32:8.635
Luis Escobar
You got two weeks of content there.
0:32:10.455 --> 0:32:15.935
Basement
Yeah. Yeah, we we've kind of like tossed around that idea a lot.
0:32:17.475 --> 0:32:31.675
Basement
We don't like currently have the best like space to do it, but it's something that I think we've been wanting to do for a while of kind of like setting up a space. We have a whole area over there that you can't see, but setting up some type.
0:32:22.415 --> 0:32:22.615
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:32:29.455 --> 0:32:29.855
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:32:31.675 --> 0:32:33.755
Basement
Of space where we're able to do more stuff like that.
0:32:33.835 --> 0:32:39.435
Basement
But yeah, I completely agree that long form video that you can turn into reels and Tiktok.
0:32:34.495 --> 0:32:34.815
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:32:39.745 --> 0:32:40.425
Basement
Boxes.
0:32:40.495 --> 0:32:45.575
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Or it may be convenient to find like a local studio.
0:32:41.665 --> 0:32:41.825
Basement
Yeah.
0:32:47.675 --> 0:32:50.235
Luis Escobar
There's like we go to one here in Miami all the time.
0:32:50.235 --> 0:32:54.235
Luis Escobar
It's like I don't know, 100 bucks an hour, but it's really professional.
0:32:54.235 --> 0:32:59.75
Luis Escobar
There's like 70 cameras staring at you by the time you walk out, you have all the files in your e-mail.
0:33:1.105 --> 0:33:2.25
Basement
That's awesome.
0:33:1.505 --> 0:33:1.985
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:33:3.105 --> 0:33:3.625
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:33:3.475 --> 0:33:4.595
Basement
Do do we have anything like that?
0:33:4.835 --> 0:33:10.475
Basement
Yeah, in local. Yeah, because I know several of my friends that are using the same space.
0:33:10.475 --> 0:33:14.35
Basement
Yeah, yeah. And a lot of them just look pretty neutral.
0:33:11.415 --> 0:33:14.575
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah. You don't need to build a whole studio, you know?
0:33:15.55 --> 0:33:19.55
Luis Escobar
Yeah, like building a studio. If you wanna do it right. It is an investment, right?
0:33:19.685 --> 0:33:20.245
Basement
Yeah.
0:33:20.515 --> 0:33:20.835
Luis Escobar
Oh yeah.
0:33:22.795 --> 0:33:25.475
Basement
We we have high quality.
0:33:27.475 --> 0:33:27.715
Basement
Lights.
0:33:29.45 --> 0:33:29.245
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:33:29.275 --> 0:33:31.115
Basement
Camera video all that.
0:33:32.715 --> 0:33:43.355
Basement
But so, so, so we we we can do a lot of the B roll we can do client testimonials and it's very high quality.
0:33:32.815 --> 0:33:33.375
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:33:41.565 --> 0:33:41.765
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:33:45.205 --> 0:33:45.405
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:33:46.515 --> 0:33:48.355
Basement
But yeah, nothing.
0:33:48.705 --> 0:33:52.25
Basement
That's set up like that or looks like that, that's for sure.
0:33:52.25 --> 0:33:58.385
Basement
So and they probably have full professional cameras in there or is this like a semi professional?
0:33:53.35 --> 0:33:53.675
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:33:58.425 --> 0:34:5.985
Basement
We could probably, if we did, wanna explore that option, get way, you know, like crisp video and crisp audio.
0:34:4.935 --> 0:34:5.455
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:34:6.705 --> 0:34:15.305
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, definitely do the research. I'm sure you can find someone and and for what you're getting out of it is well worth it, right?
0:34:8.265 --> 0:34:9.585
Basement
I know we have spaces here.
0:34:9.585 --> 0:34:10.545
Basement
I haven't looked it up.
0:34:15.385 --> 0:34:23.825
Luis Escobar
So I mean, they'll, you know, they'll these guys, for example, they'll give you the files with like, it automatically switches the camera to the whoever is speaking.
0:34:25.355 --> 0:34:27.835
Luis Escobar
So that that saves a few hours of editing.
0:34:25.765 --> 0:34:26.525
Basement
Yeah, that's awesome.
0:34:27.765 --> 0:34:34.685
Basement
Yes, a friend of mine just sold his movie that he shot, produced, and wrote.
0:34:33.945 --> 0:34:34.145
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:34:37.515 --> 0:34:38.35
Basement
To Netflix.
0:34:39.365 --> 0:34:39.725
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:34:39.595 --> 0:34:43.675
Basement
So he's down here, so he has a full studio too.
0:34:45.355 --> 0:34:47.515
Basement
And Zack, Zack would do something for us, for sure.
0:34:45.515 --> 0:34:45.915
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
0:34:49.315 --> 0:34:50.715
Basement
I also wanted to ask you quickly.
0:34:49.325 --> 0:34:49.765
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:34:51.185 --> 0:34:51.385
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:34:52.435 --> 0:34:56.755
Basement
We also kind of like when it comes to content and things like a 90 minute podcast.
0:34:58.665 --> 0:35:10.705
Basement
Obviously, we utilize Lisa a lot for videos, but when it comes to like our providers and things like that, obviously their time is best spent with clients and members.
0:35:2.645 --> 0:35:2.845
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:35:10.705 --> 0:35:19.945
Basement
So what do you think about? Like I know hims and hers specifically, like hires, actors and things like that that do their podcast.
0:35:19.945 --> 0:35:21.985
Basement
I'm just wondering what your opinion is on that.
0:35:22.755 --> 0:35:26.155
Basement
Or if we should use local, you know our people for it.
0:35:22.805 --> 0:35:23.765
Luis Escobar
Absolutely, yeah.
0:35:27.15 --> 0:35:30.175
Luis Escobar
No, that's definitely go with some actors.
0:35:30.175 --> 0:35:31.335
Luis Escobar
I I've used them.
0:35:31.375 --> 0:35:32.335
Luis Escobar
Many, many times.
0:35:32.335 --> 0:35:34.135
Luis Escobar
Actually on fiber, right?
0:35:34.135 --> 0:35:35.495
Luis Escobar
So these are people.
0:35:35.495 --> 0:35:38.535
Luis Escobar
Who they do this for a living. So they they know how to speak to the camera.
0:35:39.955 --> 0:35:45.555
Luis Escobar
The the we just got to put together, you know the right script for them and they'll pull it off.
0:35:44.685 --> 0:35:45.165
Basement
Yeah.
0:35:45.555 --> 0:35:50.435
Luis Escobar
We tell them, you know, we want them to be walking while they're talking or we want them like in a sophisticated studio setting.
0:35:52.195 --> 0:35:54.675
Luis Escobar
But yeah, we can find those those actors on Fiverr.
0:35:52.815 --> 0:35:54.55
Basement
Mother. Yeah.
0:35:56.205 --> 0:35:58.485
Basement
Very first videos that we ever did.
0:35:58.685 --> 0:36:17.485
Basement
We hired actors like back in 2011 and he came in from 2 miles away. And you know, we said we wanted a 48 year old male physician, you know, wearing a coat. And I mean, that guy was ******* on point.
0:36:9.755 --> 0:36:9.955
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:36:17.565 --> 0:36:18.485
Basement
I mean, he just.
0:36:18.645 --> 0:36:21.85
Basement
I mean, he immediately gained gained your trust.
0:36:21.85 --> 0:36:21.765
Basement
You know, it's like.
0:36:21.815 --> 0:36:22.15
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:36:22.515 --> 0:36:24.35
Basement
You know, it was good.
0:36:25.625 --> 0:36:27.665
Luis Escobar
Dan, we'll we'll make it really worthwhile.
0:36:27.665 --> 0:36:31.985
Luis Escobar
So like, we'll get a few videos out of the actor. We'll get some.
0:36:33.475 --> 0:36:35.155
Luis Escobar
Like YouTube style videos.
0:36:35.395 --> 0:36:40.155
Luis Escobar
Some, like short clips. Also variations of ads.
0:36:40.155 --> 0:36:49.915
Luis Escobar
So last time I worked with an actor I I gave her 20 scripts. I gave her thirty call to actions and 30 hooks.
0:36:50.395 --> 0:36:55.475
Luis Escobar
So when you combine all that, you actually end up with like about a 120 combinations or something like that.
0:36:57.345 --> 0:37:2.465
Basement
What's a hook compared to a CTA? Like what?
0:37:2.85 --> 0:37:3.925
Luis Escobar
The hook is. The hook comes first.
0:37:3.925 --> 0:37:8.125
Luis Escobar
That hook is the first three seconds, right?
0:37:8.125 --> 0:37:10.45
Luis Escobar
That that, that really catches your attention, right?
0:37:12.635 --> 0:37:13.395
Luis Escobar
You know that.
0:37:14.145 --> 0:37:18.225
Basement
Like like like like if you said this is like a random example, but if you said.
0:37:19.755 --> 0:37:23.155
Basement
95% of men die every year because their tennis runs low.
0:37:23.155 --> 0:37:25.635
Basement
OK. And you're like, oh, I'm a man.
0:37:24.185 --> 0:37:24.345
Luis Escobar
Who?
0:37:26.35 --> 0:37:26.195
Basement
OK.
0:37:26.675 --> 0:37:27.635
Basement
I'm like that type of thing.
0:37:30.415 --> 0:37:33.975
Basement
And then the CTA is like, wait, you know, at the very end.
0:37:36.955 --> 0:37:39.755
Basement
Buy buy here save 50% click here.
0:37:45.325 --> 0:37:51.45
Luis Escobar
I'll share an example so this is how we can, you know, get get 50 or 100 videos out.
0:37:45.415 --> 0:37:45.615
Basement
2.
0:37:47.335 --> 0:37:48.15
Basement
20 spots left.
0:37:51.45 --> 0:37:55.845
Luis Escobar
Do some really like aggressive split testing and.
0:37:57.275 --> 0:38:0.555
Luis Escobar
Out of those eighty, you know, we're gonna figure out which one's working out, which one's not.
0:38:0.715 --> 0:38:1.995
Luis Escobar
Do you see my screen right now?
0:38:1.995 --> 0:38:2.715
Luis Escobar
I'm sharing this document.
0:38:3.515 --> 0:38:3.995
Basement
Yeah.
0:38:4.905 --> 0:38:9.585
Luis Escobar
So here's the these are like the entire scripts I gave her to read verbatim.
0:38:10.65 --> 0:38:11.705
Luis Escobar
And then here are the hooks.
0:38:12.265 --> 0:38:14.945
Luis Escobar
Are you a fund manager struggling to outperform the market?
0:38:15.745 --> 0:38:17.905
Luis Escobar
Does your family office still have an edge right?
0:38:18.425 --> 0:38:22.265
Luis Escobar
So one is speaking to fund managers, the other one is speaking to family office.
0:38:22.265 --> 0:38:30.425
Luis Escobar
So that's how we change the hook. Now speaking about changing the Cta's, it's either DM us the word fast to get started with us today.
0:38:31.395 --> 0:38:32.435
Luis Escobar
Click the link below.
0:38:33.435 --> 0:38:36.835
Luis Escobar
Tap the link below right so all these little variations you know.
0:38:37.265 --> 0:38:43.345
Luis Escobar
We're gonna figure out which one is is getting the most results so.
0:38:43.195 --> 0:38:44.315
Basement
Can you send us?
0:38:44.315 --> 0:38:52.595
Basement
Can you send us like that document and take out any, you know thing that's proprietary?
0:38:49.785 --> 0:38:49.905
Luis Escobar
Mm H.
0:38:52.955 --> 0:39:1.715
Basement
It's cool for me to see how we could incorporate. I mean like I could give you ideas because I know our business better, right?
0:38:53.315 --> 0:38:53.715
Luis Escobar
I got you.
0:38:55.905 --> 0:38:56.105
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:38:59.295 --> 0:38:59.495
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:39:1.755 --> 0:39:5.355
Basement
I mean but but but but if I saw that.
0:39:2.405 --> 0:39:2.605
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:39:6.135 --> 0:39:6.335
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:39:6.875 --> 0:39:7.75
Basement
Document.
0:39:8.785 --> 0:39:9.545
Luis Escobar
Absolutely.
0:39:8.795 --> 0:39:13.515
Basement
It might actually prompt prompt me to think of things that I've never thought of before.
0:39:13.95 --> 0:39:13.175
Luis Escobar
Up.
0:39:14.745 --> 0:39:15.625
Basement
And.
0:39:14.845 --> 0:39:16.125
Luis Escobar
Absolutely. I'll share this.
0:39:17.395 --> 0:39:23.715
Basement
We've done a lot of work on like her, her sonas too, right?
0:39:23.875 --> 0:39:41.315
Basement
I mean, you know, you know, the 30 to 35 year old guy, the 303035 year old girl, you know and and and what what are their pain pain points or their hopes or their you know, what's the emotion that you're trying to evoke there?
0:39:24.465 --> 0:39:24.665
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:39:37.95 --> 0:39:37.295
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:39:41.355 --> 0:39:42.275
Basement
You know, so.
0:39:43.305 --> 0:39:46.745
Basement
I can share share that with you as well.
0:39:50.215 --> 0:39:51.175
Luis Escobar
Understood. Absolutely.
0:39:51.175 --> 0:39:57.855
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that's definitely, you know, part of the strategy is is getting, you know, several different personas put together.
0:39:59.315 --> 0:40:4.995
Luis Escobar
Do can I have access to? I guess your Google Drive or or your Dropbox where all these documents reside.
0:40:5.805 --> 0:40:7.805
Basement
I sent it to you.
0:40:8.355 --> 0:40:11.235
Luis Escobar
OK, so that everything is in there already got it.
0:40:11.345 --> 0:40:16.625
Basement
Dropbox. Yeah, so. So you have been invited to the team folder.
0:40:16.705 --> 0:40:22.105
Basement
The a new team folder which should have.
0:40:24.395 --> 0:40:29.435
Basement
I I'll it's you know, we're in the process I think of reorganizing it or or maybe.
0:40:31.235 --> 0:40:35.875
Basement
It's what like for those documents, though I don't.
0:40:31.975 --> 0:40:32.295
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:40:35.875 --> 0:40:37.795
Basement
I think there's two different drop boxes.
0:40:37.835 --> 0:40:38.795
Basement
Is there OK?
0:40:38.875 --> 0:40:39.635
Basement
Yeah. OK.
0:40:39.755 --> 0:40:40.755
Basement
I'll look and see.
0:40:41.865 --> 0:40:43.665
Basement
The one you shared is more content.
0:40:45.155 --> 0:40:52.115
Basement
Like creative, and I think there's another one that has, like all the documents in it like that the providers use and stuff.
0:40:45.255 --> 0:40:47.495
Luis Escobar
More content. OK, that.
0:40:53.955 --> 0:40:59.515
Basement
The one that I shared has. If you shared the one that says it could be called the same thing though.
0:40:59.515 --> 0:41:2.115
Basement
So I really don't know, but it's OK that has this folder.
0:41:4.145 --> 0:41:5.505
Basement
Like it looks like that.
0:41:5.865 --> 0:41:6.185
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:41:5.865 --> 0:41:8.585
Basement
Yeah, that that's what I shared.
0:41:8.825 --> 0:41:13.705
Basement
Yeah, but doesn't that have everything under underneath of it though?
0:41:10.515 --> 0:41:10.995
Luis Escobar
Got.
0:41:15.275 --> 0:41:20.115
Basement
If I gave them access to that that main, he should have access to everything.
0:41:20.755 --> 0:41:27.715
Basement
Yeah, I'm just saying I don't. If those documents you're talking about are in this this red box, it could be in, in the other account.
0:41:27.715 --> 0:41:29.275
Basement
Yeah. OK.
0:41:29.275 --> 0:41:31.355
Basement
So I'm just saying maybe try to give him access to the other one too.
0:41:31.355 --> 0:41:33.115
Basement
OK. Or just in case?
0:41:33.265 --> 0:41:33.865
Luis Escobar
Either.
0:41:34.185 --> 0:41:40.985
Basement
And what I'm talking about to that cause, yeah, the more I'm thinking about it, maybe I don't have that in there.
0:41:41.25 --> 0:41:41.785
Basement
So yeah.
0:41:41.575 --> 0:41:41.935
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:41:43.355 --> 0:41:46.435
Luis Escobar
But yeah, that will also, you know, organize all your data.
0:41:43.715 --> 0:41:43.955
Basement
Yeah, we.
0:41:46.435 --> 0:41:50.875
Luis Escobar
And I mean another good reason why to move to Google, right?
0:41:50.875 --> 0:41:55.195
Luis Escobar
Having everything in Google Drive, the team can just be more streamlined.
0:41:56.75 --> 0:41:57.355
Luis Escobar
We'll cross that road when we get there.
0:41:57.355 --> 0:42:1.75
Luis Escobar
Right now, just as much data as you can provide me the better.
0:42:1.155 --> 0:42:7.755
Luis Escobar
I'm already feeding a lot of this stuff to this AI that I'm working with, it's it's called Manus.
0:42:8.555 --> 0:42:9.835
Luis Escobar
Ted, I might have told you about it before.
0:42:12.235 --> 0:42:13.75
Luis Escobar
Manus.
0:42:12.475 --> 0:42:15.195
Basement
If you did, I drank way too much, probably.
0:42:17.575 --> 0:42:20.735
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it's a Chinese AI MINUS.
0:42:23.635 --> 0:42:25.675
Luis Escobar
These guys are insane.
0:42:25.675 --> 0:42:34.755
Luis Escobar
I don't know what they're feeding them, but there's it's blowing chat, GTP gem, and I all the American Pella lambs exploring them out of the water.
0:42:34.755 --> 0:42:38.435
Luis Escobar
Then the news is not talking about this. I think for some.
0:42:37.945 --> 0:42:38.705
Basement
Of course.
0:42:40.715 --> 0:42:42.635
Luis Escobar
They're like leaps and bounds ahead of us.
0:42:44.305 --> 0:42:47.25
Luis Escobar
So I'm gonna get us access to it.
0:42:47.25 --> 0:42:51.265
Luis Escobar
It's gonna be a big player in putting these AI initiatives together for us.
0:42:56.635 --> 0:42:56.915
Basement
OK.
0:42:56.915 --> 0:42:58.755
Basement
So what do you need from us?
0:42:58.755 --> 0:43:0.915
Basement
What? What else I mean?
0:43:0.915 --> 0:43:14.795
Basement
Because I I want to create like you said, like a two week Sprint that's really focused that that you'll we need to focus on making it rain now. I mean you'll making our ads better.
0:43:12.685 --> 0:43:13.85
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
0:43:14.875 --> 0:43:16.475
Basement
Brian, this is where you could jump.
0:43:15.225 --> 0:43:15.425
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:43:16.475 --> 0:43:17.635
Basement
Jump in too.
0:43:18.275 --> 0:43:21.235
Basement
You know what are we gonna do to make our ads better?
0:43:21.955 --> 0:43:25.395
Basement
What are we gonna do to get to get our front door?
0:43:26.785 --> 0:43:35.985
Basement
Yeah, I think the debate was do we do we just pull off the Band-Aid now and go back to work?
0:43:37.635 --> 0:43:38.795
Basement
Or do we?
0:43:38.835 --> 0:43:41.915
Basement
Do we do we stay inside HubSpot?
0:43:43.875 --> 0:43:44.555
Basement
You know.
0:43:44.505 --> 0:43:47.625
Luis Escobar
I I'm I'm ready to execute on WordPress.
0:43:49.755 --> 0:43:52.555
Luis Escobar
I'm in the next 24 hours, right?
0:43:52.555 --> 0:43:55.275
Luis Escobar
You're gonna see just some of the initial.
0:43:57.635 --> 0:44:8.315
Luis Escobar
Steps taken right to to get us to a fully functional WordPress ecosystem where every lead is technically a user of our website, right?
0:44:8.315 --> 0:44:13.595
Luis Escobar
They have an account on enu.com where or hypertracking all their activities.
0:44:14.385 --> 0:44:21.345
Luis Escobar
They can access all their resources and one of the most crucial ones is they can access their affiliate portal.
0:44:14.605 --> 0:44:14.805
Basement
Great.
0:44:16.705 --> 0:44:16.865
Basement
OK.
0:44:21.425 --> 0:44:27.305
Luis Escobar
So as soon as you become a lead, as soon as you become a client, you're at the same time becoming an affiliate.
0:44:28.295 --> 0:44:32.895
Basement
Or a refer or a referral, yeah.
0:44:33.635 --> 0:44:38.355
Luis Escobar
Yeah, like you, you instantly get like your own tracking URL.
0:44:35.155 --> 0:44:36.115
Basement
Have you shared?
0:44:38.355 --> 0:44:48.835
Luis Escobar
It'll be, you know, inu.com/ted and then anybody who lands on that URL and buys is gonna be credited to you.
0:44:49.595 --> 0:44:49.715
Basement
Huh.
0:44:51.425 --> 0:44:51.945
Basement
Can you?
0:44:51.945 --> 0:44:55.225
Basement
Do you have written down anywhere the actual?
0:44:56.915 --> 0:45:2.35
Basement
What? What the referral Pro program and the affiliate program is?
0:45:2.355 --> 0:45:11.275
Basement
Yeah, 'cause, I think I think it would be good for him to understand where where our heads were and then see if he sees any flaws in that.
0:45:2.895 --> 0:45:3.935
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it's called.
0:45:12.355 --> 0:45:13.595
Basement
Yeah, I will send that over to you.
0:45:13.635 --> 0:45:17.595
Basement
The best WordPress affiliate management plugin.
0:45:18.385 --> 0:45:20.825
Luis Escobar
Yeah, please share that with me as soon as you can.
0:45:20.825 --> 0:45:25.945
Luis Escobar
However, I I I've already got this. My plan is to recommend we use this one.
0:45:25.985 --> 0:45:28.425
Luis Escobar
It's called affiliatewp.com.
0:45:29.955 --> 0:45:30.235
Luis Escobar
Has many.
0:45:31.735 --> 0:45:34.935
Basement
We have that lull again.
0:45:34.935 --> 0:45:36.815
Basement
What's cool about that?
0:45:35.455 --> 0:45:36.55
Luis Escobar
Idea.
0:45:36.855 --> 0:45:55.255
Basement
What's cool about that is you can go to like the great grandchild, like like what affiliates sold, you know, signed on other Affiliates and signed on other affiliates like, like, they could actually get paid at a multi level type thing.
0:45:43.705 --> 0:45:43.905
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:45:50.665 --> 0:45:51.145
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
0:45:56.355 --> 0:45:58.675
Basement
Yeah, it's pretty funny. Cool it.
0:45:57.25 --> 0:45:58.185
Luis Escobar
That is correct, yeah.
0:45:58.665 --> 0:46:2.345
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I've I've multi tiered, they call it right.
0:45:58.675 --> 0:45:59.115
Basement
It's free.
0:46:2.345 --> 0:46:3.545
Luis Escobar
So something like this?
0:46:3.985 --> 0:46:7.625
Basement
Yeah, yeah, I mean that.
0:46:7.625 --> 0:46:13.505
Basement
That's when you start getting the power of like, you know Alexa Collins, you know.
0:46:11.885 --> 0:46:12.5
Luis Escobar
Yes.
0:46:16.55 --> 0:46:16.215
Basement
Yeah.
0:46:16.75 --> 0:46:22.875
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah. I thought you get also like a lot of, like really, like, popular influencers, right?
0:46:23.195 --> 0:46:37.155
Luis Escobar
Not only do they know that they can, you know, generate a lot of income by promoting the product to their network, but if they can also they also know a lot of other big influencers that big affiliates, so they they love if they can get a cut from.
0:46:37.155 --> 0:46:38.35
Luis Escobar
Their efforts.
0:46:40.715 --> 0:46:45.995
Basement
Well, I think that that's a huge opportunity for us.
0:46:46.905 --> 0:46:49.65
Luis Escobar
But yeah, I mean.
0:46:50.915 --> 0:46:56.195
Luis Escobar
With WP affiliate you know this is gonna sync directly with HubSpot.
0:46:56.835 --> 0:47:0.635
Luis Escobar
We're also gonna be using this plug in right here called WP Fusion.
0:47:5.35 --> 0:47:7.275
Luis Escobar
I have a developer license that I can share.
0:47:11.195 --> 0:47:15.435
Luis Escobar
But essentially this is a really deep integration with HubSpot.
0:47:17.275 --> 0:47:26.595
Luis Escobar
And for example WP affiliate deep integration with open AI that they integrate with a lot of different players.
0:47:26.795 --> 0:47:30.155
Luis Escobar
But essentially this is how we make sure that all that data is getting sent to HubSpot.
0:47:41.45 --> 0:47:42.965
Luis Escobar
Right now, are you guys running ads?
0:47:47.35 --> 0:47:49.875
Brian Hyatt
Yes, we're only running Google ads right now.
0:47:51.275 --> 0:47:52.395
Luis Escobar
Only Google ads.
0:47:51.395 --> 0:47:53.515
Brian Hyatt
Except for. Well, that's not true.
0:47:53.515 --> 0:47:57.395
Brian Hyatt
We're running Google ads for optimal health. We're running.
0:47:58.995 --> 0:48:0.515
Brian Hyatt
Meta ads for aesthetics.
0:48:4.825 --> 0:48:7.865
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I see you have several campaigns up and running.
0:48:11.795 --> 0:48:13.35
Luis Escobar
Cost per contact.
0:48:13.635 --> 0:48:17.515
Luis Escobar
Are you guys tracking your cost per lead cost per contact or?
0:48:17.165 --> 0:48:18.805
Brian Hyatt
Yes. Yep.
0:48:18.985 --> 0:48:21.185
Luis Escobar
How's that been trending?
0:48:22.255 --> 0:48:23.895
Brian Hyatt
So in March.
0:48:25.355 --> 0:48:29.835
Brian Hyatt
The cost per contact was $2200.
0:48:31.595 --> 0:48:36.955
Brian Hyatt
In April, it was 1500 and now we have it right around 900 so.
0:48:37.355 --> 0:48:38.475
Luis Escobar
At around 900.
0:48:38.795 --> 0:48:42.275
Brian Hyatt
Yeah. So it's it's dropping and moving in the right direction, but.
0:48:43.915 --> 0:48:44.875
Brian Hyatt
Still higher than what we want.
0:48:44.175 --> 0:48:44.615
Luis Escobar
Great.
0:48:46.715 --> 0:48:50.515
Luis Escobar
And now that number is at how are you calculating this?
0:48:50.515 --> 0:48:54.115
Luis Escobar
You have like another reporting process.
0:48:55.225 --> 0:49:3.865
Brian Hyatt
So the yeah, the numbers that I'm tracking that off of her, the actual appointments that are booked for.
0:48:55.475 --> 0:48:56.115
Luis Escobar
To figure that out.
0:49:5.595 --> 0:49:7.515
Brian Hyatt
For them to come in and do their initial.
0:49:9.235 --> 0:49:13.315
Brian Hyatt
Blood draw and all that, or their initial meeting with the with the provider.
0:49:14.125 --> 0:49:17.925
Basement
Oh, so that's not even cost per acquisition.
0:49:14.755 --> 0:49:15.195
Luis Escobar
I got it.
0:49:18.645 --> 0:49:19.205
Brian Hyatt
Right.
0:49:19.875 --> 0:49:20.315
Basement
That's wow.
0:49:20.355 --> 0:49:21.795
Basement
Yeah. No, that's really high.
0:49:23.825 --> 0:49:24.585
Luis Escobar
Yeah. So right here.
0:49:24.585 --> 0:49:30.185
Luis Escobar
Contacts that interacted with an add directly before they converted to a contact in the HubSpot.
0:49:31.925 --> 0:49:33.85
Brian Hyatt
So I'm not.
0:49:32.155 --> 0:49:32.555
Luis Escobar
Right. So.
0:49:33.125 --> 0:49:40.285
Brian Hyatt
I'm not using that because that's not really given given me the information that I need to make decisions right now.
0:49:41.215 --> 0:49:41.935
Luis Escobar
I hear you.
0:49:42.115 --> 0:49:42.715
Brian Hyatt
Yeah, yeah.
0:49:43.835 --> 0:49:50.75
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Essentially we want to create this one is just one of the reports that's cost per brand new leads.
0:49:50.115 --> 0:49:58.595
Luis Escobar
But then we wanna also then have those different reports for, for example, like Dwayne just described of of the booked meeting, right.
0:49:58.875 --> 0:50:0.475
Luis Escobar
What is the cost per booked meeting?
0:49:59.355 --> 0:49:59.635
Brian Hyatt
OK.
0:50:0.475 --> 0:50:1.675
Luis Escobar
What is the cost per?
0:50:3.395 --> 0:50:8.955
Luis Escobar
Book to zoom Call versus a walk in versus a phone call, right?
0:50:8.955 --> 0:50:11.635
Luis Escobar
So we'll figure out what the cost per each is.
0:50:12.225 --> 0:50:12.985
Luis Escobar
Eventually.
0:50:21.85 --> 0:50:25.405
Luis Escobar
Also here are you guys utilizing the goals feature inside of HubSpot?
0:50:27.925 --> 0:50:30.125
Luis Escobar
So I can see you're not.
0:50:30.285 --> 0:50:32.325
Luis Escobar
This is really powerful, right?
0:50:32.805 --> 0:50:36.525
Luis Escobar
To just get the whole team really in line with like what our weekly goals are.
0:50:36.915 --> 0:50:37.35
Luis Escobar
Umm.
0:50:37.175 --> 0:50:38.415
Basement
And that's what we're talking about.
0:50:40.85 --> 0:50:40.805
Basement
The marketing team.
0:50:45.395 --> 0:50:47.475
Luis Escobar
Doesn't seem like I'm allowed to add goals.
0:50:47.475 --> 0:50:56.635
Luis Escobar
Maybe you don't have the feature or I don't have the permissions to do it, but essentially we would create goals of like revenue generated calls.
0:50:58.925 --> 0:51:1.165
Luis Escobar
Outbound calls successfully connected.
0:51:3.205 --> 0:51:7.485
Luis Escobar
Emails sent referrals generated, right?
0:51:7.485 --> 0:51:11.365
Luis Escobar
So if we set up these different KPIs and have it all tracked inside of HubSpot.
0:51:14.295 --> 0:51:14.895
Basement
Yes.
0:51:17.245 --> 0:51:17.365
Basement
Yes.
0:51:19.545 --> 0:51:24.25
Luis Escobar
Are are all the sales reps, the entire sales team in HubSpot?
0:51:25.555 --> 0:51:26.435
Brian Hyatt
They are, yes.
0:51:27.455 --> 0:51:27.975
Luis Escobar
OK.
0:51:29.275 --> 0:51:32.275
Luis Escobar
I might have sounded. Do you have?
0:51:31.265 --> 0:51:34.265
Brian Hyatt
We they're they're just under the.
0:51:32.275 --> 0:51:34.155
Luis Escobar
Do you have them like with titles?
0:51:36.665 --> 0:51:39.25
Basement
Yeah, we, we we just had to.
0:51:40.645 --> 0:51:42.445
Basement
Call center girls, I mean.
0:51:43.965 --> 0:51:48.365
Brian Hyatt
It's Melissa. And Crystal would be the the names that you're looking for.
0:51:48.675 --> 0:51:49.715
Luis Escobar
Melissa and Crystal.
0:51:49.555 --> 0:51:51.115
Brian Hyatt
Melissa Lee and.
0:51:51.135 --> 0:51:52.55
Basement
Little lane, yeah.
0:51:56.925 --> 0:52:2.845
Basement
Do I'm going to change gabo's super admin access to? Yeah.
0:52:3.295 --> 0:52:4.615
Brian Hyatt
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
0:52:6.185 --> 0:52:8.705
Luis Escobar
You must have access to other other users.
0:52:10.475 --> 0:52:12.875
Luis Escobar
I don't think I have like a super admin access.
0:52:15.825 --> 0:52:20.885
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I want to be able to log in as Melissa so I can see what she sees when she's logged in.
0:52:26.235 --> 0:52:27.555
Basement
Even though I'm I'm looking.
0:52:26.955 --> 0:52:44.355
Brian Hyatt
And that's so that's something that we can dig into and probably a good idea for you to meet with Leah, because I know the call center they have, they've really just been confused from the start of HubSpot through now.
0:52:36.375 --> 0:52:36.495
Luis Escobar
Mm H.
0:52:42.935 --> 0:52:44.95
Luis Escobar
On how to operate.
0:52:44.555 --> 0:52:53.755
Brian Hyatt
Yeah. And they're it's cleaned up much better than it was before, but they were really doing a lot of duplicate contacts and.
0:52:50.345 --> 0:52:50.545
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:52:54.605 --> 0:52:55.205
Brian Hyatt
It was.
0:52:55.245 --> 0:52:56.685
Brian Hyatt
It was a kind of a big mess.
0:52:58.205 --> 0:52:59.805
Luis Escobar
Yeah, we're going to clean that up for them.
0:53:1.365 --> 0:53:11.85
Luis Escobar
Also another you know big, another good reason why I really recommend we switch to Google Chrome to Google in general is you know everyone at the organizations.
0:53:11.85 --> 0:53:21.645
Luis Escobar
I I'm at the everyone logs into Google Chrome and then all their bookmarks and passwords and and you know history, all of it is saved into their Google Chrome.
0:53:22.285 --> 0:53:22.445
Basement
Yeah.
0:53:23.365 --> 0:53:26.245
Luis Escobar
So essentially, you know they can log into any computer in the world and operate.
0:53:27.835 --> 0:53:32.955
Luis Escobar
The same with like air Call because it's logging into Google HubSpot.
0:53:32.955 --> 0:53:35.75
Luis Escobar
Of course, just making it really simple.
0:53:35.115 --> 0:53:39.275
Luis Escobar
Everyone forgets passwords, so it's best to just keep it all saved in the browser.
0:53:39.355 --> 0:53:49.355
Luis Escobar
So I'll also, you know, work on making sure that the the workspace for, for Melissa and all the key players is as well organized to try to make them more productive.
0:53:56.875 --> 0:53:57.275
Basement
So what?
0:53:57.95 --> 0:53:58.375
Luis Escobar
I'm gonna give you an example.
0:53:57.275 --> 0:53:59.315
Basement
What is our what?
0:53:59.315 --> 0:54:0.635
Basement
What Brian?
0:54:0.635 --> 0:54:4.635
Basement
Where are we at with the Smart bug advisory?
0:54:5.75 --> 0:54:7.795
Basement
I mean it kind of seems like she should have been doing all this.
0:54:9.145 --> 0:54:22.665
Brian Hyatt
But as far as the leads with Crystal Melissa, yes, she. Like I said, we're in a much, much better spot than we were within being able to manage the leads and find the leads and and get to what we want them to be working on.
0:54:24.215 --> 0:54:28.815
Brian Hyatt
So that part's way better than than it was before.
0:54:28.855 --> 0:54:33.55
Brian Hyatt
You know, before they didn't even know what dashboard to get to or anything, so.
0:54:32.195 --> 0:54:32.395
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:54:34.985 --> 0:54:36.545
Brian Hyatt
So that's been the positive.
0:54:36.585 --> 0:54:45.425
Brian Hyatt
Now, if Luisa, if you're going to be working on that, then I think that there's other things that we need to assign to Leah.
0:54:40.165 --> 0:54:40.325
Basement
OK.
0:54:48.265 --> 0:54:49.265
Brian Hyatt
To get that in place.
0:54:49.265 --> 0:54:52.265
Brian Hyatt
So I think we just need to probably have another meeting.
0:54:52.775 --> 0:54:56.375
Brian Hyatt
To dig into like who's doing what when it comes to this.
0:54:54.735 --> 0:54:54.855
Luis Escobar
No.
0:54:56.415 --> 0:55:8.375
Brian Hyatt
And we had a call with our HubSpot. The actual HubSpot Rep earlier today that we went over some different things with and I think getting you in that conversation would be good as well.
0:55:9.785 --> 0:55:11.265
Luis Escobar
Yeah, pretty soon. Pretty soon.
0:55:12.805 --> 0:55:13.965
Luis Escobar
See for example.
0:55:16.85 --> 0:55:18.45
Luis Escobar
This is called the in hub.
0:55:18.45 --> 0:55:20.165
Luis Escobar
Spot. It's called the sales workspace, right?
0:55:21.515 --> 0:55:29.595
Luis Escobar
Seems like I'm not able to see cause of the permission access, but basically this is like they're starting point essentially.
0:55:28.295 --> 0:55:28.455
Basement
OK.
0:55:31.45 --> 0:55:32.885
Luis Escobar
Here I'm gonna show you an example of what.
0:55:34.605 --> 0:55:35.245
Luis Escobar
It should look like.
0:55:36.145 --> 0:55:36.785
Basement
Super 8.
0:55:37.355 --> 0:55:40.955
Luis Escobar
So you see right here at the start of the morning, right?
0:55:40.955 --> 0:55:42.635
Luis Escobar
Everyone comes in and they look at this.
0:55:42.635 --> 0:55:44.875
Luis Escobar
It's telling you exactly what's going on today.
0:55:44.995 --> 0:55:45.715
Luis Escobar
Their task.
0:55:45.715 --> 0:55:48.155
Luis Escobar
High priority to do calls.
0:55:49.605 --> 0:55:58.845
Luis Escobar
Right below. Is this like guided action where it's essentially you know giving you a reminder of on what follow up you got to do and there's 60 new leads are waiting for you right now.
0:55:57.285 --> 0:55:57.485
Brian Hyatt
Mm hmm.
0:55:58.845 --> 0:56:1.365
Luis Escobar
I'm logged in as one of the sales reps, so I can see what he sees.
0:56:2.485 --> 0:56:4.405
Luis Escobar
But essentially this is where he starts his day.
0:56:5.925 --> 0:56:7.485
Luis Escobar
On the right side, he's got his calendar.
0:56:8.165 --> 0:56:10.965
Luis Escobar
He had three onboardings today, apparently.
0:56:12.525 --> 0:56:19.125
Luis Escobar
Then you know what his pipeline is looking like, you know? So if he is meeting those goals or not, right?
0:56:19.125 --> 0:56:24.285
Luis Escobar
And you know, we incentivize the guys by, you know, they they reach their weekly goals or monthly goals.
0:56:25.205 --> 0:56:30.125
Luis Escobar
We give them, you know, some sort of bonus cash bonus or dinner for two or something like that.
0:56:30.165 --> 0:56:32.285
Luis Escobar
You know, motivate them to make sure they always hit those goals.
0:56:31.365 --> 0:56:31.485
Basement
Jim.
0:56:33.475 --> 0:56:35.995
Basement
That that'd be great if we could do that with our girls.
0:56:35.995 --> 0:56:38.795
Basement
I mean with, I mean just.
0:56:36.825 --> 0:56:42.345
Brian Hyatt
Where they were Luis before, when they would go to that dashboard it they didn't.
0:56:42.625 --> 0:56:48.985
Brian Hyatt
That was not set up for them that way, so they were having to come here and then they were having to go to other.
0:56:46.705 --> 0:56:46.905
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:56:50.465 --> 0:56:56.505
Brian Hyatt
Places in HubSpot like go to the contacts section and trying to navigate all of it.
0:56:54.375 --> 0:56:54.575
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:56:56.505 --> 0:57:6.385
Brian Hyatt
So when I say it was kind of a mess and they just really didn't even know where to start that now we're in a much better spot with all of this. So it looks more like it should.
0:57:6.815 --> 0:57:6.975
Brian Hyatt
Good.
0:57:8.45 --> 0:57:8.925
Luis Escobar
Great. Great.
0:57:8.925 --> 0:57:11.205
Luis Escobar
Yeah. We'll just keep evolving this, right.
0:57:12.155 --> 0:57:14.435
Basement
Friend, did you say you got him accessory?
0:57:12.685 --> 0:57:13.645
Luis Escobar
One free trial at a time.
0:57:14.755 --> 0:57:16.595
Basement
You should have super admin access now.
0:57:17.435 --> 0:57:18.435
Luis Escobar
OK, fantastic.
0:57:21.415 --> 0:57:23.615
Basement
I don't know if you have to refresh or something, but.
0:57:24.245 --> 0:57:25.845
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I think I gotta log out.
0:57:41.555 --> 0:57:49.235
Brian Hyatt
So, Louise, do you care if I jump back real quick to the marketing aspect and and the website?
0:57:49.975 --> 0:57:50.535
Luis Escobar
Yes.
0:57:51.25 --> 0:57:52.185
Brian Hyatt
What would be?
0:57:53.185 --> 0:58:4.185
Brian Hyatt
So I guess the question is, you know, we really want to be able to drive more leads, you know, right now in the next, however long before the new site goes up.
0:58:4.185 --> 0:58:7.545
Brian Hyatt
So we're looking at updating some of the landing pages.
0:58:9.895 --> 0:58:12.15
Brian Hyatt
And getting those cleaned up a little bit more.
0:58:13.665 --> 0:58:21.305
Brian Hyatt
How long of a process is it to get a new site up and running and?
0:58:23.245 --> 0:58:30.605
Brian Hyatt
You know, should we go ahead and do some of these updates that we were planning on doing while we're waiting for the new site?
0:58:31.735 --> 0:58:34.935
Luis Escobar
We can have an MVP ready by end of the week.
0:58:37.85 --> 0:58:42.165
Luis Escobar
A fresh new start, right? Growing up on what we already have.
0:58:42.165 --> 0:58:45.925
Luis Escobar
You know all the existing pages, maybe a few new ones, right?
0:58:45.925 --> 0:58:52.365
Luis Escobar
But definitely just all the existing ones and and with the brand new design.
0:58:53.885 --> 0:58:56.45
Luis Escobar
Style and overall UI UX you know.
0:58:57.885 --> 0:59:0.645
Luis Escobar
Style we can have that ready by end of week.
0:59:1.915 --> 0:59:2.195
Brian Hyatt
OK.
0:59:3.405 --> 0:59:5.605
Luis Escobar
If we can just coordinate.
0:59:3.665 --> 0:59:5.905
Brian Hyatt
So yeah, that that answers that we won't need to.
0:59:6.505 --> 0:59:9.385
Brian Hyatt
We won't need to to do any of the updates.
0:59:9.385 --> 0:59:13.345
Brian Hyatt
I don't think on the on the HubSpot site because that's a pretty pretty fast turn around.
0:59:16.295 --> 0:59:37.735
Basement
I I sent to you kind of the websites and kind of went 25 again.com has versus a new and there were many more opportunities and overall flow of the original 25. Again site is is far greater and better I think.
0:59:39.235 --> 0:59:40.755
Basement
Than than the annew.co.
0:59:42.395 --> 0:59:46.795
Basement
There's much more opportunity to grab the customers.
0:59:47.425 --> 0:59:48.545
Basement
Data so.
0:59:49.675 --> 0:59:49.875
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
0:59:57.645 --> 0:59:59.405
Luis Escobar
Do we have an account with like?
1:0:1.5 --> 1:0:1.45
Luis Escobar
A.
1:0:1.45 --> 1:0:1.525
Luis Escobar
A stock image.
1:0:3.225 --> 1:0:5.425
Luis Escobar
Service provider like Shutterstock.
1:0:5.765 --> 1:0:7.405
Basement
Yeah, we have Shutterstock.
1:0:7.105 --> 1:0:8.825
Luis Escobar
OK, perfect.
1:0:10.505 --> 1:0:12.545
Luis Escobar
And we'll get some good imagery from there.
1:0:13.155 --> 1:0:18.515
Basement
And we we should have tons of great shots, right?
1:0:18.515 --> 1:0:21.435
Basement
I mean till we have a lot of staff photos and and.
1:0:23.915 --> 1:0:31.275
Basement
BBB role of clients walking in and shaking hands with with the dark and doctor.
1:0:31.625 --> 1:0:35.385
Basement
I mean, I just see that we've done so many.
1:0:36.875 --> 1:0:38.75
Basement
I know we have pictures.
1:0:39.795 --> 1:0:47.75
Basement
But maybe she still so much. Just Lisa talking. Pam talking Pam, you know, explaining something to a patient.
1:0:47.155 --> 1:0:57.395
Basement
Just tons of like little 5 second videos of you know that you you would see on a site you know, I mean I definitely think we could get more of that.
1:0:57.395 --> 1:0:59.555
Basement
I don't think we have enough for a sight at all.
1:1:1.275 --> 1:1:1.435
Basement
But.
1:1:1.865 --> 1:1:4.25
Basement
That's what I mean, we have.
1:1:4.25 --> 1:1:5.945
Basement
So really I mean.
1:1:7.435 --> 1:1:9.155
Basement
Of stuff that you would put on the header of the site.
1:1:9.155 --> 1:1:12.835
Basement
No, I mean, yeah, we have plenty of like content.
1:1:12.835 --> 1:1:21.115
Basement
As in like that we're posting, but like something that you would put on the front of a site, you would want that to be pretty high quality.
1:1:16.475 --> 1:1:16.675
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:1:22.755 --> 1:1:23.315
Basement
And not like.
1:1:25.155 --> 1:1:27.915
Basement
I I'm very opposed to like stock.
1:1:27.995 --> 1:1:32.355
Basement
I mean, like you know, I hate using.
1:1:33.585 --> 1:1:44.465
Basement
I mean, if we have high quality, you know, imagery of our own staff, our own clients, that kind of thing, I think it's just more compelling.
1:1:44.465 --> 1:1:53.345
Basement
But yeah, I mean, if we don't, I just know that we've shot so much stuff, you know.
1:1:51.765 --> 1:1:52.245
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:1:54.205 --> 1:1:54.885
Luis Escobar
No, I agree.
1:1:54.885 --> 1:1:57.405
Luis Escobar
I mean, I think it's it's a healthy balance of both, right?
1:1:57.405 --> 1:2:2.885
Luis Escobar
You're not gonna always have all the angles or the right shots, and that's where shutterstocking can fill the gap.
1:2:5.685 --> 1:2:12.445
Luis Escobar
And also you know we can also take all the shots that you guys do have and also enhance them with AI, right?
1:2:12.995 --> 1:2:16.195
Basement
Yeah. Yeah, we have some photos.
1:2:14.75 --> 1:2:14.755
Luis Escobar
So.
1:2:17.715 --> 1:2:19.715
Basement
That I that I think would need to be enhanced.
1:2:19.715 --> 1:2:28.35
Basement
We also, I was looking at the Life Force website the other day and they use all stock imagery in their header and it's gorgeous.
1:2:21.885 --> 1:2:22.85
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:2:28.35 --> 1:2:32.955
Basement
It looks I I mean it doesn't look like this like it's very compelling.
1:2:28.845 --> 1:2:29.325
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:2:34.95 --> 1:2:34.615
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:2:34.955 --> 1:2:41.915
Basement
I think that that would change your mind a little bit on when we look at stock like this and stock of what we use on a new. I agree with you absolutely.
1:2:42.265 --> 1:2:47.25
Basement
Not, but when you look at stock like that it it changes things a little bit.
1:2:47.25 --> 1:2:50.145
Basement
'Cause I'm. I'm in the same boat as you. I don't like stock photos, but.
1:2:50.375 --> 1:2:50.895
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:2:51.675 --> 1:2:54.475
Basement
The way their header has videos is is really nice.
1:2:55.885 --> 1:2:57.365
Luis Escobar
Yeah, there is some good stock out there.
1:2:57.365 --> 1:2:59.685
Luis Escobar
You gotta, like, dig through the trenches.
1:2:58.595 --> 1:3:0.595
Basement
Yeah, yeah.
1:3:6.995 --> 1:3:15.595
Luis Escobar
But yeah, in terms of just revamping the website, yeah, that's that's something that's gonna happen immediately, right?
1:3:16.515 --> 1:3:18.355
Luis Escobar
Again, the 1.0 version right?
1:3:19.835 --> 1:3:21.435
Luis Escobar
And then and then we can just keep evolving from that.
1:3:23.115 --> 1:3:26.875
Luis Escobar
But we we don't need to keep building landing pages in HubSpot.
1:3:26.875 --> 1:3:36.435
Luis Escobar
It's. I know it's it's an interesting idea, but there's a there's a better way to operate, especially when we're trying to achieve the overarching goal of like having this centralized ecosystem.
1:3:38.155 --> 1:3:41.555
Luis Escobar
Where you you see all the content, access all the data.
1:3:42.435 --> 1:3:45.75
Luis Escobar
And we're fully tracking every action, every activity.
1:3:52.255 --> 1:3:54.775
Luis Escobar
I also wanted to bring up other like.
1:3:56.515 --> 1:3:58.875
Luis Escobar
Marketing channels, for example, have you guys considered TV ads?
1:3:58.875 --> 1:4:4.75
Luis Escobar
Noted, you mentioned something about radio was something you guys used to do?
1:4:5.165 --> 1:4:10.525
Basement
We we we done radio and TV both we like doing.
1:4:12.395 --> 1:4:17.755
Basement
You know what? What? What? Always work in the past. And I mean pre 2000.
1:4:19.235 --> 1:4:27.475
Basement
20 was live TV either live sporting or live news and then.
1:4:29.515 --> 1:4:30.955
Basement
A lot live.
1:4:33.355 --> 1:4:34.35
Basement
Radio shows.
1:4:34.545 --> 1:4:44.225
Basement
We would host here in our studios, you know where they say coming to you live from, you know us. Whatever so.
1:4:38.505 --> 1:4:38.705
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:4:42.35 --> 1:4:42.235
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:4:46.395 --> 1:4:46.955
Basement
That that works.
1:4:46.955 --> 1:4:51.395
Basement
Well, then you know we we live in a college town.
1:4:51.395 --> 1:4:55.635
Basement
So college football, college basketball so targeted.
1:4:55.635 --> 1:4:57.515
Basement
Audience for radio.
1:4:59.235 --> 1:5:5.235
Basement
Was clearly men. You know, men 25 to 55.
1:5:6.305 --> 1:5:6.425
Basement
And.
1:5:7.785 --> 1:5:10.905
Basement
60 on sports talk.
1:5:8.475 --> 1:5:8.635
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:5:12.395 --> 1:5:12.955
Basement
And then.
1:5:16.665 --> 1:5:26.945
Basement
Women would specifically respond well between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM that that Morning News.
1:5:24.875 --> 1:5:25.75
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:5:29.275 --> 1:5:35.275
Basement
That that national news, NBC that that kind of thing.
1:5:36.795 --> 1:5:39.915
Basement
I we we are not doing any of that now.
1:5:42.195 --> 1:5:46.635
Basement
Just because it it fell off, I mean just we just weren't getting.
1:5:48.225 --> 1:5:58.385
Basement
The results, but I do know that I know you. You had talked about Vibe.
1:5:59.995 --> 1:6:3.155
Luis Escobar
Yeah, vibe, I think is it's something that maybe we can explore.
1:6:0.715 --> 1:6:0.795
Basement
So.
1:6:4.635 --> 1:6:7.195
Luis Escobar
You know, throw 100 bucks at it and see if it does anything.
1:6:8.835 --> 1:6:13.275
Luis Escobar
They just made it like very accessible to to get on these different.
1:6:15.115 --> 1:6:16.115
Luis Escobar
Platforms, right?
1:6:16.395 --> 1:6:29.435
Luis Escobar
Like Hulu for example, and and so. Also I think there's good opportunity for the retargeting someone who's you know, walked into one of the locations. Somebody who's, you know, visited the website, maybe three or five times.
1:6:30.745 --> 1:6:32.945
Luis Escobar
Now they start seeing it when they're watching their Hulu.
1:6:36.735 --> 1:6:37.55
Basement
Yeah.
1:6:40.925 --> 1:6:41.765
Luis Escobar
Great, great, great.
1:6:42.255 --> 1:6:44.735
Basement
It could be helpful too for.
1:6:47.415 --> 1:6:56.415
Basement
Telehealth, if you were going outside of of our Geo market, you know with the you know 20 mile radius.
1:6:55.155 --> 1:6:55.355
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:6:57.915 --> 1:7:0.715
Basement
You know, it could, could, could be good for that as well, so.
1:7:1.605 --> 1:7:4.205
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Here, I'll show you what the back end looks like.
1:7:2.355 --> 1:7:2.955
Basement
I think having.
1:7:4.245 --> 1:7:7.365
Luis Escobar
You see, you can pick out the different age demographics.
1:7:9.725 --> 1:7:11.365
Luis Escobar
Estimated household income.
1:7:12.705 --> 1:7:14.105
Luis Escobar
Network technicity.
1:7:12.765 --> 1:7:20.925
Basement
Doesn't have TV commercials or commercials on streaming service really legitimizes like for whatever reason, I just feel like, oh, that's very professional.
1:7:21.85 --> 1:7:23.45
Basement
They have ATV commercial like I don't know.
1:7:23.525 --> 1:7:25.245
Luis Escobar
Absolutely, absolutely.
1:7:25.605 --> 1:7:27.525
Luis Escobar
And so now it's easier than ever.
1:7:27.525 --> 1:7:29.245
Luis Escobar
I mean this, this company is great.
1:7:29.245 --> 1:7:31.925
Luis Escobar
You know, get started with a $50 ad budget.
1:7:32.925 --> 1:7:34.685
Luis Escobar
Same thing as running meta ads.
1:7:37.445 --> 1:7:41.45
Basement
And there's a direct connect with HubSpot.
1:7:42.795 --> 1:7:47.995
Luis Escobar
Yeah. I mean, in terms of, they have their own cracking pixel actually, right?
1:7:47.995 --> 1:7:52.435
Luis Escobar
So we we can make the correlation, send that data to help solve.
1:7:54.475 --> 1:7:56.995
Basement
Can you connect that with untitled?
1:7:54.875 --> 1:7:59.35
Luis Escobar
And that's where, that's where those different, that's where those different domains can come into play, right?
1:7:56.995 --> 1:7:59.315
Basement
I have no idea.
1:7:59.35 --> 1:8:8.275
Luis Escobar
So like if if somebody signs up in new123.com then now we know that person came from our CNN or.
1:8:9.515 --> 1:8:10.875
Luis Escobar
What are the cases?
1:8:11.215 --> 1:8:11.655
Basement
Right.
1:8:20.535 --> 1:8:20.895
Basement
OK.
1:8:20.895 --> 1:8:21.535
Basement
So where?
1:8:21.535 --> 1:8:22.615
Basement
Where do we start?
1:8:22.615 --> 1:8:23.695
Basement
What? What's the?
1:8:26.595 --> 1:8:35.515
Basement
Next, I mean, do we want to look at the next day, the next two days or or this week or what we give you access to click up.
1:8:26.995 --> 1:8:27.35
Luis Escobar
I.
1:8:36.895 --> 1:8:37.95
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:8:37.115 --> 1:8:38.955
Basement
Do you wanna what?
1:8:38.955 --> 1:8:39.795
Basement
What did you do?
1:8:39.795 --> 1:8:49.515
Basement
You put, I guess some of his initial recommendations into a task under his it's it's just a separate list and click up we had a.
1:8:50.945 --> 1:8:55.465
Basement
We have like a backup or a backlog list and we didn't want to.
1:8:56.185 --> 1:8:59.265
Basement
We didn't want these tasks to kind of mix with those.
1:8:59.265 --> 1:9:5.625
Basement
We wanted to keep them separate, so we made like a separate list. I think it's called Louis tasks, but.
1:9:4.945 --> 1:9:5.385
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:9:7.75 --> 1:9:8.515
Basement
We kind of built out.
1:9:10.835 --> 1:9:12.995
Basement
Like six or seven or eight or something like that.
1:9:12.995 --> 1:9:19.75
Basement
Tasks or projects so far and we kind of just need to go through probably and add the rest.
1:9:19.505 --> 1:9:27.65
Basement
Tomorrow, broad descriptions. Yeah. And then go through and add like the subtask we were in a bigger group meeting.
1:9:27.65 --> 1:9:28.65
Basement
I think we can do it with.
1:9:30.195 --> 1:9:35.115
Basement
You know the people who are gonna do the task to build out the sub tasks of what they need for to complete that.
1:9:35.115 --> 1:9:42.315
Basement
So that's kind of where we're at right now that that's a nice way of them saying, Ted, we don't want you in the meeting.
1:9:44.755 --> 1:9:46.115
Basement
I didn't.
1:9:50.265 --> 1:9:51.105
Luis Escobar
No good, good deal.
1:9:51.105 --> 1:9:52.825
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'm logged into. Click up now.
1:9:54.465 --> 1:9:54.785
Basement
Yeah.
1:9:55.445 --> 1:9:56.925
Luis Escobar
Perfect. Perfect.
1:9:57.985 --> 1:10:1.65
Luis Escobar
Yeah, right now I I believe I have everything I need, right.
1:10:1.785 --> 1:10:13.905
Luis Escobar
I I wanna reconvene basically 24 hours from now. We we can do a call tomorrow. Same time at 4:00 or is it? Does that work for you guys?
1:10:18.465 --> 1:10:21.865
Basement
Do you have class at 5530?
1:10:21.865 --> 1:10:23.905
Basement
What your I do at 5:30?
1:10:25.355 --> 1:10:26.635
Basement
Can you move it up to 3:30?
1:10:27.585 --> 1:10:28.865
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.
1:10:30.335 --> 1:10:31.855
Basement
Yeah, 3 referrals would be better.
1:10:30.395 --> 1:10:31.675
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it'll. It'll be more of a.
1:10:32.595 --> 1:10:34.235
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it'll be a streamlined meeting.
1:10:34.305 --> 1:10:40.305
Luis Escobar
I think we can really give you an understanding of like everything I found in terms of my audit, right?
1:10:41.915 --> 1:10:44.595
Luis Escobar
But yeah, I have what I need for now.
1:10:46.315 --> 1:10:51.995
Luis Escobar
I wanna make sure also that I'm connected on teams if if there's any channels I need to be added to or.
1:10:54.215 --> 1:10:56.615
Basement
I'll add you to the marketing.
1:10:54.305 --> 1:10:55.225
Luis Escobar
Should we create like a?
1:10:56.815 --> 1:11:3.775
Basement
We just have like, yeah, I'll add you to the marketing team. One right, Brian?
1:11:3.775 --> 1:11:5.735
Basement
I think that's the only like.
1:11:7.545 --> 1:11:8.705
Basement
Necessary one.
1:11:9.435 --> 1:11:10.635
Brian Hyatt
Yeah, I think so.
1:11:9.465 --> 1:11:9.665
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:11:10.875 --> 1:11:26.395
Brian Hyatt
And if you if you wanna touch base with me anytime before that meeting or anytime after so that we can look at you know the some of the questions with HubSpot or if you have any questions there, just let me know.
1:11:26.395 --> 1:11:30.275
Brian Hyatt
We do have a weekly call with Lea from Smart Bug.
1:11:31.795 --> 1:11:40.995
Brian Hyatt
Wednesday mornings at 9 AMI. Don't know if you would wanna jump on there. If we need to find a different time to connect with her. She's flexible.
1:11:41.305 --> 1:11:44.705
Brian Hyatt
So that'd be good as well.
1:11:42.305 --> 1:11:45.385
Basement
Did she forget that anything in writing or like?
1:11:45.735 --> 1:11:46.295
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:11:46.735 --> 1:11:47.535
Luis Escobar
Yeah, that could work.
1:11:47.535 --> 1:11:51.535
Luis Escobar
And I guess Brian could do you want to schedule a meeting with me tomorrow morning?
1:11:54.25 --> 1:11:54.665
Luis Escobar
Could be like a.
1:11:54.45 --> 1:11:57.405
Brian Hyatt
Yeah, yeah, that's let me take a look.
1:11:57.295 --> 1:11:57.815
Luis Escobar
Time.
1:11:57.405 --> 1:12:5.645
Brian Hyatt
We've got our 9:30 call. Normally that we touch base with the team, but outside of that I'm I'm available.
1:12:6.905 --> 1:12:9.465
Luis Escobar
9:30 you said I could do.
1:12:9.5 --> 1:12:11.285
Brian Hyatt
Yeah. And they usually just last 30 minutes.
1:12:12.875 --> 1:12:15.75
Luis Escobar
I could do 9:00 to 9:30.
1:12:15.815 --> 1:12:16.135
Brian Hyatt
OK.
1:12:16.135 --> 1:12:17.95
Brian Hyatt
Yeah, let's see that.
1:12:18.905 --> 1:12:22.945
Luis Escobar
Great. Great. That'll do. A 30 minute pawalo and then.
1:12:22.355 --> 1:12:24.35
Basement
Brian Brian did.
1:12:24.35 --> 1:12:31.195
Basement
Didn't you ask the smart bug lady to give you kind of a written what's been done so far?
1:12:32.415 --> 1:12:40.135
Brian Hyatt
Yes, she said that she would send that by end of day today, which I still haven't seen that. So I'll I'll follow up with her again.
1:12:37.415 --> 1:12:37.495
Basement
Oh.
1:12:41.635 --> 1:12:43.955
Brian Hyatt
And see what is going on there.
1:12:42.5 --> 1:12:46.245
Basement
Yeah, I think that's that's something that I'd like to see.
1:12:46.245 --> 1:12:50.45
Basement
I think be helpful because we've engaged with.
1:12:48.965 --> 1:12:53.685
Brian Hyatt
Ask for an update on hours to like how many hours have been spent.
1:12:51.995 --> 1:12:52.875
Basement
Them yeah, yeah.
1:12:56.715 --> 1:12:57.155
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:12:57.435 --> 1:13:2.515
Luis Escobar
And so they're like a hot spot consultant agency, I'm guessing.
1:13:1.895 --> 1:13:4.255
Brian Hyatt
They yeah. Yeah, they are.
1:13:4.255 --> 1:13:10.935
Brian Hyatt
They were actually one of the top recommendations from HubSpot with partners that they work with. So that's why we went with them.
1:13:11.775 --> 1:13:14.15
Brian Hyatt
We purchased 20 hours.
1:13:15.875 --> 1:13:20.195
Brian Hyatt
And so yeah, that we can.
1:13:20.195 --> 1:13:27.515
Brian Hyatt
We can jump into that a little bit more tomorrow, but we the past couple calls I have shared with them that we need to stop on the gas.
1:13:27.515 --> 1:13:31.635
Brian Hyatt
I think that's the the biggest concern that we have is we need to.
1:13:31.825 --> 1:13:34.65
Brian Hyatt
Move a little bit faster than what we have been.
1:13:36.985 --> 1:13:38.665
Luis Escobar
Yeah, you know we can.
1:13:39.335 --> 1:13:44.415
Luis Escobar
We can definitely, you know, make a lot of big changes if hub slots really dialed in.
1:13:47.175 --> 1:13:53.415
Luis Escobar
The workflows is something I'm gonna be reviewing to make sure that you know which ones are running.
1:13:50.355 --> 1:13:50.555
Brian Hyatt
Mm hmm.
1:13:53.415 --> 1:13:54.375
Luis Escobar
Why are they running?
1:13:54.375 --> 1:13:55.535
Luis Escobar
What are they doing for us?
1:13:56.255 --> 1:14:6.255
Brian Hyatt
I think that's our our biggest need after getting through and fixing the the leads and and the confusion that Crystal and Melissa were having, just be able to find the leads.
1:14:6.395 --> 1:14:6.595
Basement
Still.
1:14:6.855 --> 1:14:10.815
Brian Hyatt
So I think that's that's the next big step for sure.
1:14:19.185 --> 1:14:21.785
Basement
I think yeah for sure.
1:14:23.205 --> 1:14:25.445
Luis Escobar
So I don't see you guys have automations here.
1:14:30.285 --> 1:14:31.445
Luis Escobar
Workflows.
1:14:35.295 --> 1:14:35.455
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:14:36.925 --> 1:14:37.685
Luis Escobar
Oh, there you are.
1:14:37.375 --> 1:14:40.575
Brian Hyatt
Good. Hey, I was gonna say there should be a good amount in there.
1:14:38.125 --> 1:14:38.965
Luis Escobar
I was missing then.
1:14:40.575 --> 1:14:48.455
Brian Hyatt
I know that Zamina has been going through and updating some things which we definitely wanna get you in in touch with her as well.
1:14:50.315 --> 1:14:50.635
Luis Escobar
Got it.
1:14:51.75 --> 1:14:53.355
Luis Escobar
Current client SMS subscriptions.
1:14:54.575 --> 1:14:54.895
Luis Escobar
Got it.
1:14:54.895 --> 1:14:57.55
Luis Escobar
And you guys are using Haymarket, right?
1:14:57.965 --> 1:15:1.485
Brian Hyatt
We're actually using both right now because.
1:15:3.185 --> 1:15:12.745
Brian Hyatt
There's a little bit of confusion with our team and when I came on board, they were just like we're running out of SMS. And so there's the character limit.
1:15:14.295 --> 1:15:23.775
Brian Hyatt
So they were looking at it more from that SMS was one message and they didn't realize that sometimes it was taking up two or three.
1:15:14.965 --> 1:15:15.165
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:15:25.225 --> 1:15:25.865
Brian Hyatt
Credits, if you will.
1:15:27.355 --> 1:15:27.835
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:15:27.915 --> 1:15:29.795
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, all right.
1:15:29.795 --> 1:15:30.875
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I'm gonna audit that.
1:15:30.875 --> 1:15:32.995
Luis Escobar
Maybe we stick with Haymarket.
1:15:34.195 --> 1:15:35.515
Luis Escobar
Maybe we switch?
1:15:35.595 --> 1:15:43.435
Luis Escobar
I mean, so the the project blue, the people I'm recommending, they provide iMessage and also SMS.
1:15:45.305 --> 1:15:48.985
Luis Escobar
And their packages are like really good. It's unlimited SMS.
1:15:48.985 --> 1:15:52.745
Luis Escobar
Actually they they just charge on the iMessage side of things.
1:15:58.625 --> 1:16:0.345
Basement
So, like, how does that work?
1:16:0.345 --> 1:16:2.625
Basement
Does it send out it? You'll send it?
1:16:3.145 --> 1:16:4.425
Basement
You'll send it via.
1:16:6.235 --> 1:16:6.595
Basement
Via via.
1:16:8.675 --> 1:16:10.155
Basement
What iMessage?
1:16:9.105 --> 1:16:9.945
Luis Escobar
Yeah, hotspot.
1:16:10.875 --> 1:16:16.595
Basement
No, no, but but but, but it is sent as a text first or as an iMessage.
1:16:11.25 --> 1:16:11.985
Luis Escobar
So like right?
1:16:17.385 --> 1:16:18.745
Luis Escobar
It'll go as an iMessage.
1:16:18.745 --> 1:16:26.705
Luis Escobar
So it it'll know already who has an iPhone and who doesn't. If it's an Android, it'll go out as an SMS.
1:16:26.735 --> 1:16:27.455
Basement
It does.
1:16:27.965 --> 1:16:28.885
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah.
1:16:28.915 --> 1:16:29.35
Basement
Huh.
1:16:31.965 --> 1:16:40.605
Luis Escobar
It's limited to, so the way it works, it's these guys actually have real iPhones in a in a in a warehouse and they're connected.
1:16:40.65 --> 1:16:40.585
Basement
Can you tell?
1:16:41.165 --> 1:16:53.5
Luis Escobar
Yeah, yeah, it's it's really nifty, but we're limited to 40 new imessages per line per day, right?
1:16:53.5 --> 1:16:53.565
Luis Escobar
We can.
1:16:53.765 --> 1:16:59.765
Luis Escobar
We can always send ongoing imessages to existing contacts in our book, but Apple I guess.
1:17:0.465 --> 1:17:8.705
Luis Escobar
They, if they notice, you're sending out a bunch of images to brand new contacts, they'll they'll red flag us and then we'll have to. They'll pause the account and we'll have to get it unpaused.
1:17:9.765 --> 1:17:14.845
Basement
So 4040 new leads or new numbers a day?
1:17:14.925 --> 1:17:18.445
Basement
But there's no limit on existing clients that we have.
1:17:20.235 --> 1:17:22.795
Luis Escobar
Existing conversations, right?
1:17:22.705 --> 1:17:23.65
Basement
Oh.
1:17:24.265 --> 1:17:27.665
Luis Escobar
So we'll we'll start 40 new conversations today.
1:17:28.395 --> 1:17:28.795
Basement
OK.
1:17:29.255 --> 1:17:35.375
Luis Escobar
On one line we can get 2 lines and do 80. We can do 4 lines and do 160 right? So.
1:17:36.945 --> 1:17:52.825
Luis Escobar
That's how we we aggregate and make a cumulative and anything that's not iMessage just goes out as an SMS. And yeah, I think it's a great move just to like we don't need to have so many different softwares running, we just need a few of them and keeping.
1:17:52.825 --> 1:17:57.305
Luis Escobar
It all centralized in HubSpot, so people are not jumping in and logging into different systems.
1:17:59.255 --> 1:17:59.535
Basement
OK.
1:17:59.535 --> 1:18:3.655
Basement
Well, did the team just gonna need to know sooner rather than later who's doing what?
1:18:3.655 --> 1:18:4.375
Basement
And I guess.
1:18:5.835 --> 1:18:13.395
Basement
Once tomorrow, we'll kind of go through everything and we'll sign tasks, I guess within.
1:18:15.505 --> 1:18:16.145
Basement
Look up.
1:18:18.915 --> 1:18:26.555
Basement
I just want to make sure that that everybody knows who's responsible for what and by when.
1:18:19.305 --> 1:18:19.905
Luis Escobar
Yeah, click up.
1:18:30.555 --> 1:18:35.35
Luis Escobar
I'm looking here at the Lewis task data migration create patient portal.
1:18:35.35 --> 1:18:37.635
Luis Escobar
I have integrate AI operations for account.
1:18:37.635 --> 1:18:41.915
Luis Escobar
Yep, Yep. Go up last night. Look on access.
1:18:42.715 --> 1:18:44.715
Luis Escobar
Yeah, the the HIPAA compliance stuff.
1:18:43.135 --> 1:18:43.775
Basement
We.
1:18:44.755 --> 1:18:52.235
Luis Escobar
I I wanna have a meeting about that specifically just to make sure we're being compliant.
1:18:54.785 --> 1:19:3.425
Basement
Those were tasks not necessarily assigned to you, but recommended by you that you would impart at least a sign.
1:19:3.665 --> 1:19:4.385
Basement
I think so.
1:19:4.385 --> 1:19:4.985
Basement
The the.
1:19:7.365 --> 1:19:12.745
Luis Escobar
So I did some research about like HIPAA compliancy and essential when it comes to AI, right?
1:19:13.415 --> 1:19:19.815
Luis Escobar
It's just essentially that there are LLM models that that take this into account.
1:19:21.305 --> 1:19:27.505
Luis Escobar
And we want to have that data locally stored by a server that you guys own, right?
1:19:28.65 --> 1:19:30.185
Luis Escobar
Not, not not with a third party.
1:19:38.805 --> 1:19:43.245
Basement
Yeah, it would be super cool for us to somehow.
1:19:44.595 --> 1:19:57.115
Basement
Create you know how you you created a podcast. A 5 minute podcast that kind of explained the challenges you know of our initial call I could see.
1:19:53.365 --> 1:19:53.885
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
1:19:56.445 --> 1:19:56.565
Luis Escobar
Mm H.
1:19:57.555 --> 1:20:1.555
Basement
I could see a podcast on somebody's health.
1:20:1.555 --> 1:20:7.555
Basement
You know things that have changed since their last meeting. You know, that kind of thing. Now, of course.
1:20:2.625 --> 1:20:2.705
Luis Escobar
Mm.
1:20:8.25 --> 1:20:18.185
Basement
You'd have to log into your account to make it HIPA compliant, but but I I think that that it would be really cool for them to get excited about.
1:20:19.675 --> 1:20:25.355
Basement
You know, maybe they're coming in for their very first time and and the podcast.
1:20:26.875 --> 1:20:29.955
Basement
Has their blood serum levels, you know?
1:20:29.955 --> 1:20:30.515
Basement
Oh wow.
1:20:30.515 --> 1:20:34.155
Basement
Looks like and we also know what their pains have been.
1:20:34.395 --> 1:20:37.355
Basement
I have been with this person had been will sleep.
1:20:37.705 --> 1:20:39.585
Basement
Wow, they're going to see you.
1:20:39.585 --> 1:20:47.25
Basement
You'll get them hyped up for all the things that they're going to hear about in the meeting.
1:20:45.945 --> 1:20:46.145
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:20:47.25 --> 1:20:52.25
Basement
I think that would be ******, you know? So it takes our story.
1:20:52.105 --> 1:20:53.345
Basement
It's like a pre story.
1:20:54.795 --> 1:20:57.915
Basement
To the story that could potentially even be better.
1:20:59.635 --> 1:21:1.155
Basement
In office, you know so.
1:21:4.275 --> 1:21:4.675
Basement
No.
1:21:4.425 --> 1:21:6.105
Luis Escobar
Tell me about your testimonials.
1:21:6.105 --> 1:21:6.665
Luis Escobar
Do you?
1:21:6.665 --> 1:21:11.305
Luis Escobar
Do you have a library of video testimonials? Written testimonials?
1:21:12.515 --> 1:21:13.155
Basement
Yeah, we do.
1:21:14.635 --> 1:21:14.915
Basement
We have.
1:21:14.755 --> 1:21:15.195
Luis Escobar
Great.
1:21:16.795 --> 1:21:27.595
Basement
Old ones that I think Ted has talked to you about before and then we also have like ones we've done within the last, you know, six months or more.
1:21:28.655 --> 1:21:29.775
Luis Escobar
Yeah, recent ones.
1:21:30.465 --> 1:21:31.705
Basement
Yeah, we have. We have.
1:21:31.705 --> 1:21:34.665
Basement
We have tons and tons of old.
1:21:36.835 --> 1:21:46.875
Basement
YouTube testimonials they just use if they use a name, they're gonna use the brand name 25 five again.
1:21:47.195 --> 1:21:50.875
Basement
But they are real people, real clients.
1:21:50.875 --> 1:21:55.955
Basement
You know that we filmed and we have tons of testimonials.
1:21:55.995 --> 1:21:59.795
Basement
So if you had AI recreate those.
1:21:58.385 --> 1:21:58.585
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:22:0.265 --> 1:22:3.625
Basement
I mean, we can certainly say these are real written more.
1:22:3.625 --> 1:22:8.345
Basement
You know, these are real spoken words by actors or whatever, you know.
1:22:10.825 --> 1:22:14.425
Basement
What I'm saying is we have really great stuff.
1:22:15.65 --> 1:22:22.705
Basement
It's just not great quality because it's old and it's it's from a different brand, you know, so.
1:22:24.125 --> 1:22:35.605
Luis Escobar
So yeah, I think we should like implement a new initiative to try to get some fresh new testimonials in in the next, you know, week or two maybe.
1:22:34.785 --> 1:22:39.865
Basement
Yeah, we are doing that currently. Yeah. So we already kinda have that started.
1:22:37.115 --> 1:22:37.275
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:22:40.385 --> 1:22:50.145
Basement
I need to be involved though, just to give you content like ideas of what we needed, what they need to say, or I mean like what we're trying to get out of them.
1:22:40.815 --> 1:22:41.295
Luis Escobar
Great.
1:22:49.165 --> 1:22:57.5
Luis Escobar
You. Yeah. I mean, it's great if some of them, like, are organically off the cuff, are good on camera and know what to say.
1:22:57.165 --> 1:23:0.925
Luis Escobar
But sometimes it's easier if you tell them exactly what to say.
1:22:59.185 --> 1:23:1.785
Basement
We like prompt them with questions.
1:23:4.875 --> 1:23:5.675
Basement
Yeah, we have.
1:23:5.675 --> 1:23:13.195
Basement
I have a list of questions that I came up with that we asked them, but I mean we don't tell them what to say by any means.
1:23:9.155 --> 1:23:9.635
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:23:14.295 --> 1:23:18.495
Luis Escobar
OK. And incentivize them somehow, right?
1:23:15.275 --> 1:23:17.115
Basement
Just because I don't know.
1:23:18.495 --> 1:23:21.935
Luis Escobar
Like I don't know a discount or something for providing the video.
1:23:21.95 --> 1:23:21.935
Basement
Yeah, we give them.
1:23:21.935 --> 1:23:25.935
Basement
Yeah. Yeah. For their, their their time.
1:23:27.355 --> 1:23:31.115
Basement
Yeah, I mean we we never want to pay anybody for saying something that isn't true.
1:23:32.835 --> 1:23:33.835
Basement
And we never have.
1:23:33.915 --> 1:23:36.875
Basement
And quite, quite frankly, in the past, we never had to offer.
1:23:37.395 --> 1:23:42.835
Basement
I mean, folks were voluntarily so happy with we haven't given anyone anything.
1:23:42.835 --> 1:23:43.995
Basement
Yeah, yeah.
1:23:44.315 --> 1:23:51.635
Basement
Sometimes people will ask though, but but, but I do I the point is we want to be in.
1:23:53.225 --> 1:24:4.945
Basement
Tenfold on, you know, what are the common pains that people are are facing, and we need to make sure that we're getting that out of them. You know, we.
1:24:6.755 --> 1:24:17.475
Basement
All saying I want to lose weight or I've lost weight. We we need, you know, men saying that women saying it and then we need to look at all the other things that we treat as well.
1:24:17.475 --> 1:24:22.355
Basement
So yeah, we have a working document of basically all the pain points.
1:24:22.945 --> 1:24:25.225
Basement
All the aid troops for men and women.
1:24:26.755 --> 1:24:30.475
Basement
There's no way to take the old.
1:24:27.35 --> 1:24:27.315
Luis Escobar
OK.
1:24:33.355 --> 1:24:49.435
Basement
Old branded Ted testimonials and basically use those words with the new brand name and just create an AI image.
1:24:49.475 --> 1:24:50.875
Basement
I mean AI video.
1:24:51.745 --> 1:24:53.425
Luis Escobar
Naii avatar like.
1:24:53.75 --> 1:24:53.515
Basement
With yeah.
1:24:54.265 --> 1:24:57.585
Basement
Yeah, I mean, but but a real looking individual.
1:24:54.995 --> 1:24:55.35
Luis Escobar
A.
1:24:58.95 --> 1:24:58.895
Luis Escobar
I know it's.
1:25:0.795 --> 1:25:16.555
Luis Escobar
There's some good ones out there, but it's they're not always that good and something with a testimonial is like, I don't know, people. People might feel type of way if they realize it's it's a, it's an AI generated testimonial. Not not.
1:25:15.745 --> 1:25:17.705
Basement
Yeah. No, I I agree.
1:25:17.705 --> 1:25:21.25
Basement
I mean but but but you see it on ads all the time.
1:25:18.435 --> 1:25:18.475
Luis Escobar
A.
1:25:21.25 --> 1:25:28.25
Basement
Where it says actor or portrayal of a real testimony, you know, that kind of thing so.
1:25:28.265 --> 1:25:30.545
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I just, I don't know.
1:25:30.545 --> 1:25:39.425
Luis Escobar
I feel like your guys are in such a good position. Just 'cause you have physical locations, you got people walking, humans walking into your places every day, right?
1:25:39.955 --> 1:25:44.355
Basement
Yeah, but not not everybody's camera ready or.
1:25:46.755 --> 1:26:1.835
Basement
Representative of how we want, you know, that's why they have models doing Cologne and stuff like that because people want to feel like they look like that when they wear that, you know, I mean so.
1:25:47.725 --> 1:25:48.285
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:26:3.355 --> 1:26:4.115
Luis Escobar
You're right.
1:26:3.515 --> 1:26:4.835
Basement
We're kind of in that same boat.
1:26:5.805 --> 1:26:6.805
Luis Escobar
Actually, you're right, Todd.
1:26:6.805 --> 1:26:18.605
Luis Escobar
Let's I think we should get that actor contracted as soon as possible, and that should be one of the videos we get them to create is basically like a testimonial type.
1:26:20.155 --> 1:26:23.75
Luis Escobar
User generated content right praising the product.
1:26:27.345 --> 1:26:28.745
Basement
But we have to put on that.
1:26:28.745 --> 1:26:29.745
Basement
It's an actor, right?
1:26:29.745 --> 1:26:32.385
Basement
Yeah, I mean, we're just fine.
1:26:30.775 --> 1:26:31.255
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:26:32.385 --> 1:26:35.385
Basement
I mean, I mean real testimonial.
1:26:37.195 --> 1:26:38.555
Basement
Actor portray whatever.
1:26:38.555 --> 1:26:41.395
Basement
But I mean like real, real work, I mean.
1:26:42.985 --> 1:26:43.385
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm mm hmm.
1:26:46.695 --> 1:26:50.615
Basement
We we didn't with the physician, but he wasn't claiming to do any there.
1:26:50.615 --> 1:26:51.895
Basement
He just looked into.
1:26:55.815 --> 1:27:11.235
Basement
It's just they're able to do it because they have the lights, camera action right there and it's just them. So you pick out three women, 3, three men, and you get them to say four or five different scripts and testonials and it's just done like, you know it.
1:26:56.575 --> 1:26:56.935
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:27:2.445 --> 1:27:2.645
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:27:11.235 --> 1:27:19.375
Basement
Just done and it's like instead of us having to try to set it up, get it, you know, get the mic. Right, get the.
1:27:19.375 --> 1:27:21.775
Basement
I mean, I think we we should still do.
1:27:20.645 --> 1:27:21.125
Luis Escobar
Yeah.
1:27:22.435 --> 1:27:25.555
Basement
It is my my, no, no, we we should still.
1:27:26.225 --> 1:27:29.505
Basement
For for web, for.
1:27:28.865 --> 1:27:29.65
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:27:30.955 --> 1:27:32.355
Basement
It's just for organic.
1:27:32.475 --> 1:27:33.955
Basement
Yeah, well, I mean.
1:27:33.875 --> 1:27:34.75
Luis Escobar
Mm hmm.
1:27:36.155 --> 1:27:38.675
Basement
Maybe we'll we'll blend it in with these.
1:27:38.715 --> 1:27:45.835
Basement
Yeah, you know, I just think it's important that we have both, because then there's also the people who are like, oh, that person looks like me.
1:27:40.745 --> 1:27:41.625
Luis Escobar
Yeah, I agree.
1:27:47.255 --> 1:27:48.655

Luis Escobar
Currently, let's let's short list, you know, a few of these guys and and put out some some bids.
1:28:10.645 --> 1:28:10.765
Luis Escobar
Umm.
1:28:16.995 --> 1:28:22.75
Basement
Yeah, like, like the ones that were shot at my, my, my house.
1:28:23.595 --> 1:28:28.675
Basement
Those were actors all saying, yeah, yeah, yeah. Same lines, you know, so.
1:28:30.125 --> 1:28:34.965
Luis Escobar
So I'm inside of the Dropbox, but I'm not sure if I'm seeing everything.
1:28:36.475 --> 1:28:37.75
Luis Escobar
Let's see.
1:28:41.275 --> 1:28:43.475
Basement
Is there anything I can help with right now?
1:28:42.865 --> 1:28:46.705
Luis Escobar
Of files, there's nothing.
1:28:45.865 --> 1:28:48.65
Basement
Shoot me a message or so.
1:28:49.835 --> 1:28:50.475
Basement
I don't run on.
1:28:52.395 --> 1:28:56.675
Basement
You you accepted the the invite.
1:28:57.695 --> 1:28:58.535
Luis Escobar
I see.
1:29:0.925 --> 1:29:1.85
Basement
OK.
1:29:1.145 --> 1:29:1.905
Luis Escobar
John bugs.
1:29:4.855 --> 1:29:8.55
Luis Escobar
This one, a new team folder.
1:29:13.635 --> 1:29:18.35
Luis Escobar
I guess I got to upgrade because it's it's larger than two gigs. That's.
1:29:13.685 --> 1:29:14.285
Basement
Account.
1:29:19.175 --> 1:29:21.175
Basement
But should it make you upgrade though?
1:29:21.635 --> 1:29:24.515
Luis Escobar
Yeah. Shouldn't I be, like on a teams account on a company?
1:29:23.905 --> 1:29:24.705
Basement
Yeah.
1:29:26.355 --> 1:29:32.515
Basement
Well, it's a Dropbox account, but it shouldn't. I should.
1:29:32.515 --> 1:29:33.675
Basement
I was able to add you.
1:29:33.675 --> 1:29:35.355
Basement
Did you have to pay more though?
1:29:35.995 --> 1:29:39.435
Basement
No, because I had one available, I thought.
1:29:41.965 --> 1:29:44.115
Luis Escobar
Link your team account I think.
1:29:45.515 --> 1:29:48.675
Luis Escobar
And I'm not sure if it knows that I'm part of the Eno team.
1:29:50.5 --> 1:29:51.645
Basement
Yeah, it may, may not.
1:29:52.325 --> 1:29:54.765
Basement
Oh yeah, that's a good point.
1:29:56.395 --> 1:29:56.475
Basement
If.
1:29:58.515 --> 1:29:58.755
Basement
You're.
1:30:0.355 --> 1:30:0.795
Basement
I don't know.
1:30:2.595 --> 1:30:6.515
Basement
We can see who we have like if we if I have you like on our.
1:30:12.765 --> 1:30:14.5
Basement
Actually I don't know how.
1:30:15.515 --> 1:30:24.195
Basement
To be able to see Members if you go in the Dropbox, a new team folder, it'll show you the members.
1:30:28.155 --> 1:30:29.275
Basement
No, I don't.
1:30:29.275 --> 1:30:39.755
Basement
I also don't own a strawbox, so maybe if you could go up to my office today and tomorrow or whatever, just make sure he has. It is likely that I set it up wrong.
1:30:39.825 --> 1:30:42.305
Basement
So I if I did it wrong.
1:30:41.665 --> 1:30:44.865
Luis Escobar
All good. Yeah. When you get a chance, just share that.
1:30:47.35 --> 1:30:49.195
Luis Escobar
So I can start digging into all that content.
1:30:53.65 --> 1:30:55.225
Brian Hyatt
I just said Louise.
1:30:53.145 --> 1:30:55.385
Basement
Oh yeah, you do have access to it.

Brian Hyatt

1:31:1.435 --> 1:31:1.915
Brian Hyatt

Brian Hyatt
Me and everybody else was maybe that helps, I don't know.
1:31:7.385 --> 1:31:7.745
Basement
Perfect.
1:31:14.245 --> 1:31:14.925
Luis Escobar
Let me log out.
1:31:16.605 --> 1:31:19.325
Basement
Louis, is there anything I can help with right now?
1:31:19.885 --> 1:31:22.725
Basement
I'm gonna try to get a few more things done here.
1:31:24.395 --> 1:31:25.955
Basement
Or or finish.
1:31:25.315 --> 1:31:29.155
Luis Escobar
The the website rightnowenew.co.
1:31:31.315 --> 1:31:34.235
Luis Escobar
What hosting provider do you guys use for that?
1:31:36.745 --> 1:31:37.385
Brian Hyatt
HubSpot.
1:31:37.545 --> 1:31:39.385
Basement
I knew that was like, do you know Brian?
1:31:40.915 --> 1:31:41.395
Basement
HubSpot right.
1:31:41.95 --> 1:31:43.735
Brian Hyatt
Yeah, everything's through HubSpot, yeah.
1:31:43.875 --> 1:31:44.315
Basement
That's right.
1:31:44.445 --> 1:31:47.485
Luis Escobar
OK, This site is hosted through HubSpot, OK.
1:31:47.715 --> 1:31:48.355
Basement
Is it true?
1:31:50.395 --> 1:31:50.915
Basement
I don't think so.
1:31:55.745 --> 1:31:57.25
Basement
That was me.
1:31:56.265 --> 1:32:4.865
Luis Escobar
I'm going to when I ask that we create an account with this hosting provider rapid cloud hosting.
1:32:9.35 --> 1:32:12.315
Luis Escobar
We can start with like the simple plan. I think it's like 100 bucks.
1:32:13.915 --> 1:32:14.555
Luis Escobar
109.
1:32:23.365 --> 1:32:26.205
Basement
You have a card, a company card, right?
1:32:26.725 --> 1:32:28.525
Basement
OK. Brian, do you have a company card?
1:32:29.975 --> 1:32:30.575
Brian Hyatt
Dot.
1:32:31.465 --> 1:32:31.785
Basement
OK.
1:32:31.785 --> 1:32:37.825
Basement
Well, if you need to buy something, Louis just we put it on one of our company cards.
1:32:39.195 --> 1:32:40.115
Luis Escobar
OK, OK.
1:32:41.875 --> 1:32:42.155
Luis Escobar
Perfect.
1:32:43.515 --> 1:32:45.715
Luis Escobar
Yeah, it's only that's the only resource right now.
1:32:46.315 --> 1:32:51.115
Luis Escobar
There's there's several resources that I already have access to, and I have developer licenses with them.
1:32:51.115 --> 1:32:53.635
Luis Escobar
So we can put some cost that way.
1:32:54.755 --> 1:32:54.995
Basement
OK.
1:32:59.785 --> 1:33:2.585
Luis Escobar
But yeah, I think I have my homework.
1:33:2.585 --> 1:33:5.385
Luis Escobar
I got quite a few things to dig my teeth in.
1:33:6.915 --> 1:33:9.715
Luis Escobar
And then we can run you and I can connect tomorrow at 9:00.
1:33:12.635 --> 1:33:13.955
Brian Hyatt
Perfect. Perfect. Yep.
1:33:14.455 --> 1:33:15.415
Luis Escobar
Yeah. OK.
1:33:15.855 --> 1:33:22.815
Luis Escobar
And then, yeah, later in in the day, same time 3:30, we said we can reconvene and and go over.
1:33:24.235 --> 1:33:33.835
Luis Escobar
Where we are and what are the next steps and what to expect by Friday and and really get a a better understanding of, you know exactly what the different sprints are gonna look like.
1:33:34.755 --> 1:33:39.275
Luis Escobar
It's gonna be a lot of a lot of things happening simultaneously. I could tell you that.
1:33:42.155 --> 1:33:43.275
Basement
Good deal.
1:33:43.275 --> 1:33:54.315
Basement
All right, I'll. I'll send out that 3330 meeting tomorrow. And then you you all can schedule the 9:00 AM and I'll see if I did get something wrong with the drop. Dropbox.
1:33:54.315 --> 1:33:57.195
Basement
But you're saying that you you see him in there, right?
1:33:57.315 --> 1:34:0.395
Basement
Yeah, I think Brian fixed it as he said.
1:34:0.955 --> 1:34:2.75
Basement
Didn't he fix it, Brian?
1:34:2.795 --> 1:34:3.595
Basement
No, Brian.
1:34:3.55 --> 1:34:3.975
Luis Escobar
Let me just.
1:34:4.205 --> 1:34:5.165
Brian Hyatt
Well, he doesn't.
1:34:5.205 --> 1:34:8.645
Brian Hyatt
I don't see where he has access, but I did add him.
1:34:8.65 --> 1:34:9.305
Luis Escobar
Doesn't seem like it.
1:34:9.305 --> 1:34:12.225
Luis Escobar
I logged out and I logged back in, but it looks the same.
1:34:11.445 --> 1:34:11.845
Brian Hyatt
Yeah.
1:34:13.315 --> 1:34:14.875
Brian Hyatt
Let me take a look again here in a minute.
1:34:15.505 --> 1:34:17.585
Basement
Talking about Dropbox or teams.
1:34:20.105 --> 1:34:20.545
Basement
OK.
1:34:24.105 --> 1:34:25.25
Luis Escobar
Something here?
1:34:26.275 --> 1:34:28.195
Luis Escobar
Your account setup may be easy.
1:34:30.515 --> 1:34:30.955
Luis Escobar
No.
1:34:41.655 --> 1:34:41.775
Brian Hyatt
Hmm.
1:34:45.535 --> 1:34:49.255
Basement
It shows you in there. On that on our team.
1:34:56.145 --> 1:35:6.545
Basement
Louis, I'm gonna work on getting you credentials for the database, but if there's nothing else I can help out on right now, I'm gonna go ahead and bounce out of here.
1:35:6.545 --> 1:35:8.265
Basement
Just let me know if there's anything I can help with.
1:35:9.185 --> 1:35:11.505
Luis Escobar
Bestie dental database.
1:35:11.955 --> 1:35:16.915
Basement
Yeah, the it's. Well, it's two different databases that I wanna get you access to.
1:35:16.915 --> 1:35:19.35
Basement
One is the open dental.
1:35:19.715 --> 1:35:24.835
Basement
It's called open medical, but it's open. Dental is a instance of their database.
1:35:24.835 --> 1:35:37.595
Basement
The few custom tables on there and then there's an omaggregation database which has some other custom tables that are built from a mix of open medical and like what used to be suite CRM or active campaign.
1:35:38.715 --> 1:35:40.515
Basement
So yeah, I wanna get you both of those.
1:35:39.335 --> 1:35:40.775
Luis Escobar
Noted noted.
1:35:42.475 --> 1:35:44.515
Luis Escobar
Perfect on the court to see that.
1:35:43.835 --> 1:35:44.195
Basement
Yep.
1:35:46.75 --> 1:35:51.475
Basement
Also, for now at least, I can give you my login to Dropbox if that helps.
1:35:52.995 --> 1:35:59.115
Basement
That's kind of what we use for all of our providers to access their content for socials. They all use my login.
1:35:59.115 --> 1:36:2.195
Basement
So we don't have to pay for a whole bunch of people.
1:36:3.875 --> 1:36:8.835
Basement
So if you want to do that until we can figure out why yours isn't showing up, we can we can.
1:36:8.875 --> 1:36:10.475
Basement
Or, you know, whatever.
1:36:9.985 --> 1:36:11.945
Luis Escobar
Yeah, please go ahead and send that.
1:36:12.625 --> 1:36:14.625
Luis Escobar
I just want to extract as much as I can.
1:36:15.55 --> 1:36:15.495
Basement
Yeah.
1:36:16.315 --> 1:36:16.715
Luis Escobar
Perfect.
1:36:21.415 --> 1:36:30.175
Basement
And then the domain is 25 again.com. So just make sure you put that. It's because it was made before.
1:36:31.905 --> 1:36:32.985
Luis Escobar
Oh, OK.
1:36:32.205 --> 1:36:35.885
Basement
Before we switch over to ANU, the the my login is yours.
1:36:37.475 --> 1:36:37.715
Basement
Yeah.
1:36:39.585 --> 1:36:41.65
Basement
Just the one that I just chat.
1:36:41.65 --> 1:36:50.385
Basement
I sent you a chat, so also let me know if that password doesn't work. I think that I'm pretty positive that's what it is, but if it doesn't I can look it up.
1:36:43.515 --> 1:36:44.35
Luis Escobar
Perfect.
1:36:52.155 --> 1:36:52.955
Basement
Reset it.
1:37:2.915 --> 1:37:7.115
Luis Escobar
I just wanna make sure I got this 'cause. I'm gonna feed all this to the AI tonight.
1:37:24.495 --> 1:37:27.375
Luis Escobar
And it says a code was sent to your e-mail.
1:37:30.735 --> 1:37:31.655
Luis Escobar
6 digit code.
1:37:35.395 --> 1:37:38.275
Basement
974160.
1:37:42.515 --> 1:37:44.475
Luis Escobar
Oh, password was incorrect.
1:37:46.155 --> 1:37:47.875
Basement
Try 1 exclamation point.
1:37:53.115 --> 1:37:53.635
Luis Escobar
No.
1:37:56.375 --> 1:37:56.655
Basement
Back.
1:37:58.265 --> 1:37:59.25
Basement
Hang on one second.
1:38:4.295 --> 1:38:4.415
Basement
Tom.
1:38:16.825 --> 1:38:16.945
Basement
Umm.
1:38:20.175 --> 1:38:22.55
Basement
Let me ask Ilda.
1:38:23.555 --> 1:38:24.115
Basement
And I will send it.
1:38:24.115 --> 1:38:30.515
Basement
I'll send another message to you on teams and I also think I have it written in my planner upstairs, so I'll I'll send you a teams chat.
1:38:26.915 --> 1:38:27.435
Luis Escobar
Perfect.
1:38:33.45 --> 1:38:33.685
Luis Escobar
OK, perfect.
1:38:33.685 --> 1:38:34.645
Luis Escobar
Yeah. I'll look out for that.
