# Re-architecture Plan for ENNU Life Assessments WordPress Plugin

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive re-architecture plan for the ENNU Life Assessments WordPress plugin. The existing plugin, while functional, exhibits several areas that could be significantly improved in terms of maintainability, scalability, extensibility, and adherence to modern WordPress development best practices. The goal of this re-architecture is to create a robust, flexible, and future-proof system for managing health assessments within a WordPress environment.

## 2. Core Architectural Principles

Building a solid foundation requires adherence to a set of guiding principles. For this re-architecture, the following principles will be paramount:

### 2.1. Modularity and Decoupling

Each component of the plugin should be self-contained and have a single responsibility. This reduces interdependencies, making the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain. Changes in one module should have minimal impact on others. This principle will be applied across all layers, from data storage to user interface components.

### 2.2. WordPress API First

Wherever possible, the plugin will leverage native WordPress APIs and functionalities (e.g., Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, Meta Boxes, Settings API, REST API, User Meta API). This ensures compatibility, security, and leverages the robust ecosystem provided by WordPress, reducing the need for custom, potentially less secure, implementations.

### 2.3. Extensibility

The architecture will be designed to be easily extendable, allowing for the addition of new assessment types, question types, reporting features, or integrations without modifying core plugin files. This will primarily be achieved through WordPress hooks (actions and filters) and a well-defined plugin API.

### 2.4. Performance Optimization

Consideration for performance will be integrated throughout the design process, from efficient database queries to optimized asset loading. Caching mechanisms will be strategically implemented where appropriate to minimize load times and server resource consumption.

### 2.5. Security by Design

All data handling, from input validation and sanitization to output escaping, will prioritize security to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. WordPress security best practices will be strictly followed.

### 2.6. User Experience (UX) Focus

The design of both the frontend assessment forms and the backend administration interfaces will prioritize a clear, intuitive, and efficient user experience for both end-users taking assessments and administrators managing them.

## 3. Proposed Data Model

The current approach of storing assessment responses directly as individual user meta keys, while simple for basic data, becomes cumbersome for complex, structured assessment data. A more robust and scalable data model is crucial. I propose a combination of Custom Post Types (CPTs) and custom database tables for optimal data management.

### 3.1. Assessment Definitions (Custom Post Type)

Each assessment (e.g., Hair Assessment, Skin Assessment) will be defined as a Custom Post Type. This allows WordPress to manage assessments as distinct entities, providing built-in features like editing interfaces, revisions, and status management. This CPT would store the overarching properties of an assessment.

**CPT Name:** `ennu_assessment_type` (e.g., `hair_assessment`, `skin_assessment`)

**Custom Fields (Meta Data) for `ennu_assessment_type`:**
*   **`assessment_slug` (Text):** A unique, machine-readable slug for the assessment (e.g., `hair`, `skin`, `health`). This will be the primary identifier used in code and URLs, replacing the need for prefixes like `ennu_hair_assessment_` in meta keys.
*   **`assessment_description` (Textarea):** A detailed description of the assessment.
*   **`assessment_version` (Text):** To track different versions of an assessment structure over time.
*   **`assessment_status` (Dropdown):** Active, Draft, Archived.
*   **`assessment_sections` (Repeater Field/JSON):** A structured way to define sections within an assessment (e.g.,
