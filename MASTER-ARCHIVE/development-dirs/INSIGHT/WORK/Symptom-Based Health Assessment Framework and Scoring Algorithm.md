# Symptom-Based Health Assessment Framework and Scoring Algorithm

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive framework for a symptom-based health assessment tool that correlates user-reported symptoms with biomarker predictions to provide health scores across multiple categories and calculate a projected biological age. The system is designed to provide immediate value to users before laboratory confirmation while maintaining scientific rigor and clinical relevance.

## 1. Assessment Framework Architecture

### 1.1 Core Health Categories

Based on the existing biomarker testing structure and research findings, the assessment covers eight primary health categories:

1. **Longevity** - Overall aging trajectory and cellular health
2. **Vitality** - Energy levels and physical performance
3. **Sexual Health** - Reproductive and sexual function
4. **Hormones** - Endocrine system balance
5. **Weight Management** - Metabolic health and body composition
6. **Cardiac Risk** - Cardiovascular health indicators
7. **Strength** - Musculoskeletal function and physical capacity
8. **Brain Health** - Cognitive function and neurological wellness

### 1.2 Symptom Questionnaire Structure

#### 1.2.1 Scoring Scale
- **Scale**: 1-5 Likert scale
- **1**: Never experience this symptom
- **2**: Rarely experience this symptom (less than once per month)
- **3**: Sometimes experience this symptom (1-3 times per month)
- **4**: Often experience this symptom (1-3 times per week)
- **5**: Always/frequently experience this symptom (daily or near-daily)

#### 1.2.2 Core Symptom Set (20 Questions)

Based on overlap analysis and biomarker correlations, the following symptoms provide maximum coverage across health categories:

**Energy & Vitality Symptoms:**

## 2. Scoring Algorithm Design

### 2.1 Symptom-to-Category Mapping

Each symptom contributes to multiple health categories with different weights based on scientific evidence:

#### 2.1.1 Mapping Matrix

| Symptom | Longevity | Vitality | Sexual Health | Hormones | Weight | Cardiac | Strength | Brain Health |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------------|----------|---------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Low Energy | 0.8 | 1.0 | 0.3 | 0.9 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.6 | 0.5 |
| Chronic Fatigue | 0.9 | 1.0 | 0.2 | 0.7 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.7 | 0.6 |
| Decreased Stamina | 0.6 | 1.0 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.8 | 0.3 |
| Poor Sleep | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.3 | 0.8 | 0.6 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.7 |
| Difficulty Recovering | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 0.6 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 0.4 |
| Unrefreshed Sleep | 0.7 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 0.7 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.8 |
| Brain Fog | 0.6 | 0.8 | 0.1 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 1.0 |

| Low Libido | 0.5 | 0.6 | 1.0 | 0.9 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.4 |
| Temperature Issues | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.3 | 1.0 | 0.4 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.3 |
| Hair/Skin Changes | 0.6 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.9 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.2 |
| Shortness of Breath | 0.7 | 0.7 | 0.2 | 0.3 | 0.8 | 1.0 | 0.6 | 0.2 |
| Heart Issues | 0.8 | 0.6 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.6 | 1.0 | 0.4 | 0.4 |

### 2.2 Category Score Calculation

For each health category, the score is calculated using a weighted average:

```
Category_Score = Σ(Symptom_Rating × Weight) / Σ(Weights)
```

Where:
- Symptom_Rating = User's 1-5 rating for each symptom
- Weight = The correlation weight from the mapping matrix
- The sum includes all symptoms that contribute to that category

### 2.3 Normalization and Scaling

Category scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale where:
- **100**: Optimal health (all symptoms rated 1)
- **80-99**: Good health (minimal symptoms)
- **60-79**: Fair health (moderate symptoms)
- **40-59**: Poor health (frequent symptoms)
- **0-39**: Critical health (severe symptoms)

Formula:
```
Normalized_Score = 100 - ((Category_Score - 1) × 25)
```

## 3. Biomarker Prediction Algorithm

### 3.1 Symptom-to-Biomarker Correlations

Based on research findings, specific symptom patterns predict biomarker levels:

#### 3.1.1 Key Biomarker Predictions

**C-Reactive Protein (Inflammation)**
- Primary Symptoms: Chronic fatigue, joint pain, frequent illness
- Prediction Formula: CRP_Risk = (Fatigue × 0.4) + (Joint_Pain × 0.3) + (Frequent_Illness × 0.3)

**Vitamin D (Hormone)**
- Primary Symptoms: Low energy, mood changes, frequent illness, bone/joint issues
- Prediction Formula: VitD_Risk = (Low_Energy × 0.3) + (Mood_Changes × 0.2) + (Frequent_Illness × 0.3) + (Joint_Pain × 0.2)

**Thyroid Stimulating Hormone**
- Primary Symptoms: Energy levels, weight changes, temperature regulation, mood
- Prediction Formula: TSH_Risk = (Low_Energy × 0.3) + (Weight_Changes × 0.3) + (Temperature_Issues × 0.2) + (Mood_Changes × 0.2)

**Testosterone (Free)**
- Primary Symptoms: Low libido, energy, mood, strength, body composition
- Prediction Formula: Test_Risk = (Low_Libido × 0.3) + (Low_Energy × 0.2) + (Reduced_Performance × 0.3) + (Mood_Changes × 0.2)

**Estradiol**
- Primary Symptoms: Hot flashes, mood changes, sleep issues, libido
- Prediction Formula: E2_Risk = (Temperature_Issues × 0.4) + (Mood_Changes × 0.2) + (Poor_Sleep × 0.2) + (Low_Libido × 0.2)

### 3.2 Risk Level Classification

For each biomarker, risk levels are classified as:
- **Low Risk** (Score 1.0-2.0): Likely optimal levels
- **Moderate Risk** (Score 2.1-3.5): May need attention
- **High Risk** (Score 3.6-5.0): Likely suboptimal, testing recommended

## 4. Biological Age Calculation

### 4.1 Methodology Selection

Based on research analysis, we employ a modified Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) approach combined with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

### 4.2 Age Calculation Formula

The biological age is calculated using a weighted combination of category scores:

```
Biological_Age = Chronological_Age + Σ(Category_Deviation × Age_Weight)
```

Where:
- Category_Deviation = (Optimal_Score - Actual_Score) / 10
- Age_Weight = Research-based multiplier for each category's impact on aging

#### 4.2.1 Age Weight Factors

| Category | Age Weight | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Longevity | 0.25 | Direct aging indicators |
| Vitality | 0.20 | Energy and cellular function |
| Cardiac Risk | 0.15 | Major mortality predictor |
| Brain Health | 0.15 | Cognitive aging impact |
| Hormones | 0.10 | Endocrine aging effects |
| Strength | 0.08 | Physical capacity decline |
| Weight Management | 0.05 | Metabolic health impact |
| Sexual Health | 0.02 | Quality of life indicator |

### 4.3 Age Range Constraints

To ensure realistic outputs:
- **Minimum Biological Age**: Chronological Age - 15 years
- **Maximum Biological Age**: Chronological Age + 25 years
- **Confidence Intervals**: ±3 years based on assessment precision
