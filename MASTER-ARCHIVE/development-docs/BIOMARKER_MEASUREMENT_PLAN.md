## **ENNU Biomarker, Scoring, and Correlation System Architecture**

This document outlines the foundational logic for the ENNU platform's interconnected systems, including the dynamic biomarker analysis, the comprehensive scoring engine, and the multi-layered data correlation matrix.

---

### **Part 1: The Biomarker Management System**

The system is designed to provide dynamic, personalized, and actionable insights into a user's health through sophisticated biomarker tracking.

#### **1.1 Dynamic Recommended Ranges**

At the core of our system is a piece of code I call the **Dynamic Recommender**. Its function is to establish personalized recommended ranges for each biomarker.

* **Foundation:** The global default ranges for all biomarkers are based on extensive research conducted by our specialized AI medical team. This clinical data provides a universal baseline for all possible scenarios.
* **Personalization Variables:** The Dynamic Recommender adjusts these baseline ranges for each user based on key variables, primarily **gender** and **age group**. Other variables can be incorporated as the system evolves.

#### **1.2 Administrator Biomarker Management Interface (WordPress Admin)**

To manage this complex data, I have conceived a centralized **Biomarkers Ranges Management Page** within the WordPress admin dashboard.

* **Purpose:** This interface allows administrators to view the global, research-backed recommended ranges for every biomarker in the system.
* **Functionality:** The fields on this page display the default range values stored in the system's code. While these fields are primarily for review and are not directly editable here, they serve as the master data source that populates user-specific profiles.

#### **1.3 User-Specific Biomarker Data Model (Admin User Edit Page)**

When an administrator views an individual's profile (`User Edit Page`), they have access to a comprehensive biomarker data panel with several layers of information.

1.  **Default Recommended Ranges:** Upon user creation, the system automatically populates fields with the recommended biomarker ranges generated by the Dynamic Recommender (based on the user's age and gender). These values are saved to the user's database record.
2.  **Manual Override Capability:** Crucially, administrators have the ability to **manually override** these default recommended ranges directly on the user's profile. This provides the flexibility to make adjustments for unique clinical scenarios, though it is expected to be a rarely used function.
3.  **Actual Lab Results:** For each biomarker, there is a corresponding data field to store the value from the user's **actual lab results**. This is where a user's objective data is entered once received.
4.  **Target Ranges:** Adjacent to the "Actual" fields are **"Target" fields**. After analyzing a user's lab results, an administrator can enter a specific, recommended target value for any given biomarker. This becomes the user's official, actionable goal for that marker.

---

### **Part 2: The End-User Experience (My Biomarkers Dashboard)**

When the user logs into their dashboard and navigates to the "My Biomarkers" tab, the complex data from the back-end is translated into a simple, intuitive visualization.

* **The Measurement Bar:** Each biomarker is represented by a visual "ruler" or measurement bar.
    * The **X-axis** of this ruler is defined by the user's specific **Recommended Ranges**.
    * A **dot** or marker will appear on the ruler, precisely indicating the value from their **Actual Lab Results**.
    * If an administrator has set a goal, a **second marker** will appear, showing the **Target** value they need to reach.

---

### **Part 3: Symptom Flagging and the User Journey**

The system intelligently connects a user's subjective experiences to objective data points through a system of assessments and flags.

#### **3.1 User Assessments and Data Capture**

Users interact with the system primarily through two categories of forms:

1.  **Welcome Assessment Form (User Registration):** This initial form captures foundational information, including the user's self-identified **Health Goals**.
2.  **Basic Health Assessments:** A suite of 8-10 specialized assessments (some gender-specific) that gather detailed health information. Submitting any of these for the first time will also initiate user registration.

#### **3.2 The Symptom Flagging Mechanism**

* **Triggering a Flag:** The questions within our health assessments are correlated with specific symptoms. When a user's answer suggests they are experiencing a particular symptom, the system automatically triggers a **"Symptom Flag"** on the associated biomarker(s).
* **Admin View:** This flag is visible to administrators on the `User Edit Page` for that specific biomarker.
* **User View:** On the front-end "My Biomarkers" dashboard, the user sees a visual indicator (e.g., a small red flag) next to the flagged biomarker, signifying that it requires attention.
* **Resolving a Flag:**
    1.  A flag indicates that the biomarker needs to be reviewed via the user's lab results.
    2.  Once lab results are submitted and entered, an administrator reviews the data.
    3.  If the lab result does not justify the flag, the admin removes it.
    4.  If the flag is justified, it remains, and the administrator will likely set a **Target** value for the user to achieve.
    5.  Once the user meets the target, the administrator can then clear the flag.

---

### **Part 4: The Comprehensive Scoring Engine**

Our platform scores users at multiple, interconnected levels to create a holistic and dynamic measure of their health.

#### **4.1 Assessment-Level Scoring**
When a user completes any scored assessment (all except the Welcome Assessment), several scores are generated and displayed on their results page:
* **Overall Assessment Score:** A single score for the entire assessment.
* **Assessment Score Breakdown:** Scores for specific categories or breakdowns within that assessment.

#### **4.2 The Four Pillars & The Life Score**
The submission of even a single scored assessment allows the system to generate a hierarchy of scores:
* **Pillar Scores:** Every assessment question is correlated to one of four foundational pillars. The system calculates a score for each: **Mind, Body, Lifestyle, and Aesthetics.**
* **Current Life Score:** At the top of the pyramid is the **Current Life Score**. This is the ultimate metric, calculated by a master algorithm that synthesizes a user's four Pillar Scores, all of their individual Assessment Scores, and their overall Biomarker Score.

#### **4.3 Biomarker Scoring**
The biomarker panel itself is a scored entity:
* **Individual Biomarker Score:** Each biomarker receives a score based on where its "Actual" value falls within the "Recommended Range" and whether it is meeting its specified "Target."
* **Overall Biomarker Score:** This is a composite score combining the scores of all individual biomarkers.

#### **4.4 The "New Life" Goal-Oriented Score**
The system doesn't just measure the present; it maps out the future.
* **The "New Life" Concept:** This refers to a set of forward-looking scores (**New Life Score**, **New Pillar Scores**) that represent reasonable, achievable goals for the user.
* **Calculation:** The system analyzes a user's current scores and their stated **Health Goals** to set these new targets.
* **Incremental Goal Achievement:** Goals are designed to be progressive. For example, if a question's options are "Good," "Better," and "Best," and the user answers "Good," the system automatically sets a "New Life" goal for them to reach "Better." Once achieved, the next goal becomes "Best."
* **Tracking Biomarker Goals:** The journey from a user's "Current Life" to their "New Life" is heavily dependent on achieving biomarker goals. The process is as follows:
    1.  The user provides their actual lab results.
    2.  Based on this data, an administrator determines if any biomarker "Targets" need to be established.
    3.  If so, these new targets become a defined set of biomarker goals for the user.
    4.  Once the user achieves a goal (confirmed by future lab results), that goal is marked as complete, moving them closer to their "New Life" score.

---

### **Part 5: The Correlation Matrix**

The entire system is powered by a sophisticated web of correlations. Understanding this is key to understanding the platform's intelligence.

* **Assessments** are correlated to:
    * **Symptoms** (triggers flags)
    * **Pillars** (generates scores)
* **Symptoms** are correlated to:
    * **Biomarkers** (determines which markers get flagged)
* **Biomarkers** are correlated to:
    * **Health Vectors** (a sub-categorization for deeper analysis, which may also be scored)
    * **Pillars** (contributes to Pillar scores)
    * **Health Goals** (provides objective metrics for tracking success)
