## üîç QUESTION-BY-QUESTION BREAKDOWN

### **Question 1: Sexual Health Symptoms**
**Question:** "In the last month, have you frequently experienced:"  
**Type:** Multiselect  
**Options:** Low Libido, Erectile Dysfunction, Irritability, Lack of Motivation, "Brain Fog"  

**Symptom Mapping:**
- **Low Libido** ‚Üí Hormones (0.8), Libido (1.0)
- **Erectile Dysfunction** ‚Üí Hormones (0.8), Heart Health (0.7), Libido (0.9)
- **Irritability** ‚Üí Hormones (0.7), Cognitive Health (0.6)
- **Lack of Motivation** ‚Üí Energy (0.6), Cognitive Health (0.5)
- **Brain Fog** ‚Üí Energy (0.7), Cognitive Health (0.8)

**Biomarker Correlations:**
- **Primary Sexual Health Biomarkers:** testosterone_total, testosterone_free, estradiol, prolactin, shbg

### **Question 2: Physical Performance**
**Question:** "How would you describe your physical endurance or stamina?"  
**Type:** Radio  
**Options:** Decreased significantly (3 points), Somewhat decreased (5 points), Has not changed (8 points)  

**Symptom Mapping:**
- **Decreased significantly** ‚Üí Strength (0.9), Energy (0.8), Longevity (0.6)
- **Somewhat decreased** ‚Üí Strength (0.7), Energy (0.6), Longevity (0.4)
- **Has not changed** ‚Üí Strength (0.3), Energy (0.3), Longevity (0.2)

**Biomarker Correlations:**
- **Performance Biomarkers:** testosterone_free, testosterone_total, igf_1, creatine_kinase, grip_strength
- **Energy Biomarkers:** ferritin, vitamin_d, vitamin_b12, cortisol, tsh, free_t3, free_t4
- **Support Biomarkers:** vitamin_d, vitamin_b12, ferritin
