1. **estradiol** - Primary estrogen assessment during menopause
2. **progesterone** - Progesterone balance during transition
3. **fsh, lh** - Pituitary function and ovarian reserve
4. **testosterone** - Androgen balance during menopause
5. **prolactin** - Can affect symptoms during transition
6. **cortisol** - Stress hormone impact during changes
7. **tsh, free_t3, free_t4** - Thyroid function (important during menopause)

### **Medium Priority Biomarkers (Test if Symptoms Persist):**
1. **vitamin_d** - Supports hormonal balance and bone health
2. **vitamin_b12** - Energy and cognitive support
3. **ferritin** - Iron status for energy
4. **magnesium** - Sleep and mood support
